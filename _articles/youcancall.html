<h1>"But <em>You</em> Can Call Me....."</h1>

<blockquote><p><em>&ldquo;It would have saved trouble had I remained Perkins from the first, this changing of women's names is a nuisance we are now happily outgrowing.&rdquo; &ndash; Charlotte Perkins Gilman in 1935 </em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Editors of women&rsquo;s papers confront a challenge editors of men&rsquo;s papers don&rsquo;t always have to consider: variants on their subject&rsquo;s name. Margaret Sanger signed documents as &ldquo;Margaret Higgins&rdquo; (her birth name), &ldquo;Margaret Sanger&rdquo; (after her marriage in 1902), &ldquo;Mrs. William Sanger&rdquo; (very occasionally), and for a brief time, &ldquo;Bertha Watson&rdquo; (the alias she used during her 1914-1915 exile). </p>

<p>Following her marriage to J. Noah Slee in 1922, she continued to use &ldquo;Margaret Sanger&rdquo; most of the time and almost always in public, but usually went by &ldquo;Mrs. J. Noah Slee&rdquo; or &ldquo;Mrs. Margaret Slee&rdquo; when traveling or if she wanted to remain under the radar, such as in 1932 when she snuck into Italy despite a ban on her imposed by Mussolini. This gave Sanger a bit of a Batman/Bruce Wayne existence she seemed to delight in, as it often tripped up opponents, old lovers and others trying to track her down on board a ship or in a hotel. Some newspapers, in an attempt to be thorough and accurate, supplied two names, implying that the woman had two distinct lives. The <em>New York Times </em>referred in 1934 to &ldquo;Margaret Sanger, who in private life is Mrs. J. Noah Slee.&rdquo; (May 27, 1934). </p>

<p>Sanger also got a kick out of being mistaken for Margaret Sangster, the popular Victorian-era American poet of Christian verse: </p>

<blockquote><p><em>
&ldquo;Sometimes, in the dusk of evening,/ I only shut my eyes,/And the children are all about me,/A vision from the skies&rdquo;</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sangster probably would have keeled over dead because of the frequent name mixup had not she already died in 1912, a couple of years before Sanger&rsquo;s became notorious as the &ldquo;Woman Rebel.&rdquo; Despite the poet Sangster&rsquo;s well-reported death, the birth control reformer Sanger continued to be confused with her; even as late as 1936 the<em> Los Angeles Times </em>reported a talk given on birth control by that well-known &ldquo;Margaret Sangster&rdquo; (Apr. 10, 1936).</p>
