<h1>"The Heart to go to Japan"</h1>

<p>"It is not an exaggeration if I say that her name [Margaret Sanger] is better known in Japan
than that of any other American or English woman," wrote Iso Abe, a professor and
Japanese birth control advocate, in a 1925 issue of the <em>Birth Control Review</em>.  "Not since
Commodore Perry had forced Japan to open its doors to foreign commerce, in 1852, had an
American created such a sensation," remembered Japanese birth control pioneer Baroness
Shidzue Ishimoto Kato in her history of the family planning movement in Japan (<em>A Fight for
Women's Happiness</em>, p. 52).  Accorded the respect and adoration usually reserved for a
visiting sovereign,  Sanger made seven trips to Japan between 1922 and 1959, grew
enchanted with the people and customs of the country, and helped to cultivate a broad-based
birth control movement that eventually won the support of the Japanese government.   Her
gratitude to the Japanese people &ndash; along with her quest for a measure of immortality &ndash; even
prompted her to draft a note expressing her wish, upon her death, to have her heart sent to
Japan.</p>

<p>     Japan, wrote Sanger in a 1922 speech draft, is the "Pivot of future peace &ndash; pivot of
international problem  . . .  War in 25 years or B. C. Today" (Farewell Address Before
Leaving for Japan, Jan. 30, 1922, <em>MSM</em> S70:924).  Alarmed by the rapid
population explosion throughout Asia that received considerable worldwide attention
following the first World War, Sanger welcomed the 1922 invitation from a liberal
publishing concern known as the Kaizo Group to make her first tour of Asia and deliver a
series of lectures in Japan.  The Kaizo sponsored series included previous tours by Bertrand
Russell and Albert Einstein.  Sanger planned a world trip around the Japan invitation, with
stops in other Asian countries, the Middle East and Europe. </p>

<p>     However, Sanger's reputation as a feminist, population controller and provocateur
preceded her to Japan. The Japanese government did not want to host a foreigner bent on
sabotaging a national policy that at the time was militantly pro-natalist, and refused to grant
Sanger a visa.  Without delay, Sanger secured a Chinese visa for a ship that sailed to Japan
via China. The long voyage gave her many opportunities to discuss her work with several
Japanese dignitaries on board, including a future prime minister and the Japanese ambassador
to the U.S.  She convinced them of the seriousness and potential benefit of her work, and
they intervened on her behalf shortly before landing in Yokohama.  Meanwhile the Japanese
press published mostly approbatory profiles of Sanger, generating interest in her life and
cause long before she set foot in Japan.  After many hours of questioning, representatives of
the Japanese government yielded to both internal and public pressure.  They agreed to allow
Sanger to enter, along with her thirteen year old son, Grant and her suitor, and
soon-to-be-husband, J. Noah Slee, on condition that she keep the subject of birth control out
of her public lectures.</p>

<p>     Sanger found that she did not need to bring up birth control in her lectures.  The stir
created by the government's inhospitality and well-publicized gag order provoked
widespread discussion of contraception and population growth in Japan.   Sanger gave
thirteen major lectures, each talk running approximately five hours due to a plodding,
simultaneous  translation.  She exhorted her audiences to " . . . set your motherhood free!
Make your women something more than breeding machines, such as the women of every
nation have been during some period of that nation's development.  The time has come for
international emancipation, based upon free, conscious maternity" ("War and Population,"
Address given at Tokyo YMCA, Mar. 14, 1922, <em>MSM</em> S70:932).</p>


<p>Sanger spoke to such groups as the Tokyo Medical Association, the Industrial Organization,
and the Tokyo YMCA.  The police, however, did not allow her to address any public
groups, thereby reserving her message for mostly upper class intellectuals.  A columnist in
the <em>Japan Chronicle</em> commented:</p>

<blockquote><p>"Mrs.  Sanger is to be allowed to address  . . .  well-to-do classes, but not the 'lower'
classes.  Yet Mr.  Yuchi  . . .  of the Metropolitan Police Department, stated to the press
that personally he thought there was every reason for encouraging Birth Control among
people of the 'lower classes;' what they were afraid of is that the propagation of the methods
advocated by her would encourage Birth Control in the well-to-do classes.   Mrs.  Sanger
must feel very perplexed.  The only point which is clear is that the authorities regard her as
an inculcator of dangerous thoughts, but do not know exactly in what way they are
dangerous.  Evidently a case of intuition."  (Japan Chronicle, March 23, 1922, included in
"Margaret Sanger in Japan," in the <em>Birth Control Review</em>, June 1922, <em>MSM</em> S70:934).</p></blockquote>

<p>     Sanger may have been perplexed and no doubt disappointed that she could not reach
larger audiences with her prepared speeches nor discuss birth control in frank terms.  But
with the assistance of Shidzue Kato, who organized Sanger's itinerary and even stood by the
door on police watch at private meetings, Sanger took part in an astonishing 500 or more
meetings or interviews in Tokyo, Kyoto and Osaka, prompting press coverage at a level
unseen before in Japan.   Sanger wrote to her secretary, "I spend at least an hour each
morning after breakfast being photographed for newspapers & magazines  . . .   My days are
crowded with lectures & reception dates &ndash; Every evening, afternoon, dinner, lunch &
morning is taken until I leave Tokyo. (Margaret Sanger to Anne Kennedy, Mar. 5, 1922,
<em>MSM</em> S2:134-137).</p>

<p>     In a thick travel journal Sanger recorded her daily activities and, in uncharacteristic
fashion, wrote lengthy entries on her impressions of Japan.  She grew fond of the Japanese
people and found their "customs and manners  . . . delightful and lovely." She characterized
the men of Japan as ambitious, but prone to "treat the government and the women not in a
serious manner." She found Japanese women to be "far behind the men in thinking and in
aggressiveness" and was "not impressed with any quality in the Japanese women" that would
lead her to believe they would "fight for their emancipation" anytime soon.  She was
overwhelmed by two observations in particular: the large number of children and the small,
congested housing units. The "sky scraper," she suggested to herself, would relieve the
claustrophobia &ndash; along of course with birth control (World Trip Journal, 1922, <em>MSM</em>
S70:110-120).</p>

<p>     Sanger's whirlwind tour ignited a small but vigorous grass roots movement for birth
control in Japan and brought increased international attention to the problem of
overpopulation in Asia.  Shortly after Sanger's visit, Shidzue Kato and other reformers
established the Japan Birth Control Study Group, which published a Japanese language
version of Sanger's controversial pamphlet on contraception, <em>Family Limitation.</em>  The
government continued to forbid public meetings to discuss birth control, but made no attempt
to curtail the distribution of contraceptive information.  Unlike America, Japan had no
specific laws or religious prohibitions to restrict the use of birth control.</p>

<p>     Sanger kept in close touch with Shidzue Kato over the next 15 years, as Kato  forged a
birth control movement in Japan that echoed Sanger's American movement.  At one point
Kato made several speaking tours in the U.S and even served an apprenticeship at Sanger's
Birth Control Clinical Research Bureau in New York.  And although Sanger did not visit
Japan in these years, her name and activities continued to influence the progress of birth
control there.  In fact Sanger's name was even illegally coopted by a Japanese manufacturer
of an abortifacient who displayed the "Sanger" product on large billboards along the railway
lines, until  Kato promised to put a stop to "such abuse" (Kato to Sanger, Mar. 8, 1931,
<span class="italicText">MSM</em> S6:109).</p>

<p>     When Sanger returned to Japan in 1937, the country was on the eve of the second
Sino-Japanese war and operating under martial law.  Shidzue Kato, now an international
presence herself after publication of her popular autobiography, <em>Facing Two Ways</em> and her
notoriety as the "Margaret Sanger of Japan," invited Sanger to dedicate the opening of the
first modern contraceptive clinic in Japan, modeled after the Birth Control Clinical Research
Bureau.  It gave Sanger an opportunity to publicly applaud Kato's efforts, placing her in
historical company alongside Mary Wollestonecraft, Madame Curie and Susan B. Anthony
(Japanese Clinic Reception, Aug. 1937, <em>MSM</em> S71:959).</p>

<p>     The 1937 trip, originally planned around a tour of China, was cut short by both an
accident (Sanger broke her arm aboard ship on the way over) and the Japanese bombing of
Shanghai.  Nevertheless, Sanger gave several lectures in Japan before the pain in her arm
and the impending war forced her to return home. During her brief visit she also attended a
series of receptions and meetings, once again raising awareness through the press of the need
for safe and effective birth control.   Sanger observed signs of rapid westernization:   "the
Western costumes . . . The use of knives and forks and spoons . . . Air-cooled systems . . .
The rickshaw is fast disappearing." But she was disappointed to find that "the progress of the
women of Japan has been retarded" (Sanger to Friends, Sept. 6, 1937, <em>MSM</em>
S13:463-464).  Several months after Sanger's visit, the right-wing government rounded up
suspected anti-government subversives, including Shidzue Kato who was arrested  for
promoting "dangerous thoughts," and shut down the new clinic.  The birth control movement
in Japan ceased until after the war.</p>

<p>     Kato spent a majority of the war in prison for opposing government policy.  She also
divorced her husband, Baron Keikechi Ishimoto and, tragically, lost her son in battle.
However, she emerged from the war determined to take a greater leadership role in her
nation.  She had remarried in 1944 (to Kanju Kato), won election to the Japanese Parliament
in 1946, and in 1947, at age 48,  gave birth to a daughter.</p>


<p>     Sanger received periodic updates on the fate of Shidzue Kato and other Japanese friends
during the war.  When the war ended, she was anxious to get news of renewed birth control
activity in Japan.  Following Sanger's well-chronicled sparring match with General Douglas
MacArthur over his refusal to allow her entrance into Japan (see <em>MSPP Newsletter </em>Number
7, Spring/Summer 1994), Sanger made five trips to the islands in the 1950s.   Postwar Japan
experienced a baby boom of similar proportions to Europe and the U.S., but the war had not
resolved the economic problems or poor living conditions that resulted from high population
density.   Many Japanese women did want to keep their families small in an effort to take
advantage of expanding economic opportunities in a rebuilding country, but because of
government suppression of birth control activity before the war, access to reliable
contraception was limited in the years of post-war reconstruction.  Increasingly, Japanese
women resorted to abortion, a trend that so alarmed the Japanese government that it adopted
a pro-family planning policy in 1951 and brought Sanger back to Japan for a return
engagement in October of 1952. </p>

<p>     Prior to the Third International Conference on Planned Parenthood, held in Bombay,
Sanger spent a week in Japan immersed in interviews and meetings, visiting clinics, and
consulting with Ministry of Health and Welfare workers about an official government family
planning program.  Kato later remembered a "fleet" of "sound trucks" circling the working
class districts of Tokyo announcing "Sanger is here! Sanger says no abortions!"
(<em>A Fight for
Women's Happiness,</em> p. 100).  The 1952 trip energized the converted and helped convince
many traditionalists within the government to support a contraceptive program.  "I firmly
believe," wrote Sanger in The Nation, "history will record the fact that no people in the
world today are making greater sacrifices in the effort to lower their birth rate than the
Japanese" ("Japan Wants Birth Control," <em>The Nation</em>, Dec. 13, 1952, <em>MSM</em>
S72:791).</p>

<p>     In 1954 Sanger returned to Japan.  The country that had imposed on her a gag order in
1922, invited her to speak on the subject "Population Problems and Family Planning" before
the Diet, the highest government body in Japan.  In doing so, Margaret Sanger became the
first foreigner accorded that honor.  1954 also brought the formation of the nationwide
Family Planning Federation of Japan.  A year later,  Sanger helped organize the Fifth
International Conference on Planned Parenthood in Tokyo, an event which welcomed Japan
into the international planned parenthood community.   Sanger made two more trips to Japan,
both in 1959, which were less official and more relaxed.  She was honored at receptions and
dinners for her achievements, and enjoyed a degree of fanfare and adoration she never
experienced in the U.S.  A year before her death in 1965, the Japanese government bestowed
upon Sanger one of its greatest honors, the Third Class of the Order of the Precious Crown,
in recognition of her enormous contributions to Japanese society.</p>

<p>     Sanger did not leave her heart in Japan; it was buried with her in Fishkill, NY.  Possibly
no one saw or took seriously her scribbled note written in the mid-1950s.  Yet the note
serves as an appropriate epitaph for the international Margaret Sanger: the reformer who
made Japan the crux of a campaign to bring health and humanity to women throughout the
world.</p>

<blockquote><p>"In case of my death &ndash; I want to be cremated not before two weeks later &ndash; The heart to
go to Japan to be buried in Tokyo &ndash; any place the Govt or Health and Welfare Minister,
together with Senator Shidzue Kato wish to have it buried, as it is or in ashes &ndash; This is
gratitude to the Japanese people & Govt &ndash; The only country in the world who have officially
recognized me & the BC work &ndash; also presented to the Emperor" (Burial Instructions, 1953?,
<em>MSM</em> S83:889-890).</p></blockquote>
