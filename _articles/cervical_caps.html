<h1>"Cervical Caps as 'Bonbons from France' and Other Sights and Scenes in the Working Friendship of Two Birth Control Pioneers"</h1>

<p>Like many others in the medical profession
who became proponents of birth control following
World War I, Hans Lehfeldt, a young German doctor
newly graduated from the University of Berlin in
1922, found inspiration in Margaret Sanger's
international crusade to make birth control safe, legal
and accessible. In 1923 Lehfeldt read a German
translation of an early Sanger book, most likely an
unauthorized translation of <em>Woman and the New
Race</em>, which influenced him decisively to pursue a
career in gynecology and may have strengthened his
inclination to help the working class (Connie
Christine Wheeler, "In Memoriam,
Hans Lehfeldt, M.D.," <em>The
Journal of Sex Research</em>,
August 1993, p. 298).  Lehfeldt
continued to be encouraged and
influenced by Sanger for the
next 40 years on his way to
becoming one of the most
influential sexologists in
the world and the author of
more than 600 writings on
contraception, reproduction
and sexual functioning.</p>
<p>The
100th anniversary of
Lehfeldt's birth (he was born
October 28, 1899) offers the opportunity to celebrate
his achievements.  And recently obtained
correspondence between Sanger and Lehfeldt,
reproduced for the Margaret Sanger Papers Project by
Dr. Connie Christine Wheeler, a close associate and
friend of Lehfeldt's, and the caretaker of his papers,
together with material in the Sophia Smith Collection
at Smith College, document one of Sanger's longest
and most harmonious associations with a doctor in the
birth control movement. Their correspondence sheds
light on Sanger's position on sterilization, an issue
she and Lehfeldt discussed at length, and underscores
the fragile nature of her alliance with the medical
community.</p>
<p>      For Lehfeldt and other liberal doctors in
Weimar Germany interested in contraception,
sexuality and women's health, Sanger
was already a recognizable
international leader in the early 1920s
who won the respect of many German
medical professionals by having the
courage to visit their war-torn country
in 1920 to investigate reports of
effective chemical contraceptives and
discuss efforts to reestablish birth
control organizations. Germany led
Europe in the field of sex reform
largely due to the pioneering work a
select group of sex reformers,
including sexologist Magnus
Hirschfeld, who first published the
influential <em>Journal of Sexual Science</em>
<em>(Zeitschrift f&uuml;r Sexualwissenschaft)</em> in
1908 and founded the Institute for
Sexual Science in 1919, which
included a sex counseling clinic and a
commitment to providing contraceptive
information.</p>
<p>     Sanger had hoped to visit
Germany, on the recommendation of
her mentor, Havelock Ellis, during her
exile in Europe in 1914-1915, but was
prevented by the war. When she finally
entered Germany in 1920 Sanger was
confronted by, in her words,  a "grim
silence" on all matters of social policy, especially sex
reform (MS, "Women in Germany," <em>The Birth
Control Review</em>, December, 1920, <em>MSM</em>
S70:84).  Few were interested in discussing organized
birth control campaigns in the midst of widespread
hunger and disease, and a sharp decline in the birth
rate.  Sanger met with Hirschfeld and other sex
reformers, formed contacts with labor and suffrage
leaders, and obtained a new contraceptive jelly
produced in Friedrichshaven that became a prototype
for the most widely used jelly in her New York clinic.
But throughout her trip she was troubled by the
inability of working-class women to obtain
birth control even though it remained
legal in Germany to manufacture and
sell contraceptives.  Was it religion,
government imposed barriers, a
conservative medical profession,
she asked both experts and
laypeople. "I thin it is the Devil,"
replied a friend in England ("Women
in Germany, Part II," <em>The Birth
Control Review,</em> January, 1921,
<em>MSM</em> S70:852)</p>
<p>     When
Sanger returned to
Germany in 1927
the devil had
lessened his grip, and the German sex reform
movement had been revitalized, even in the midst of
political uncertainty and economic instability.  While
Germany was much more liberal in its attitude toward
sex than England or America, Sanger had been
informed by Communist American writer Agnes Smedley, who reported to Sanger from Berlin, that
the abortion rate was very high and contraceptive
information scarce.  Sanger arrived in Berlin in
December 1927, following the World Population
Conference in Geneva, and gave several lectures,
offered demonstrations on fitting diaphragms, and
used her uncanny organizing skills and open
checkbook to help bring together select members of
the League of German Women Doctors, the Society
for Sexual Reform, the National League for Birth
Control and Sex Hygiene, and both the Communist
and Social Democratic Party to form a German
Committee for Birth Control that would organize a
network of contraceptive clinics and sex counseling
centers in Berlin.  "The thing my visit here has done,"
Sanger told Edith How-Martyn, her
chief associate in international work,
"is to crystallize the idea & give
confidence to those who needed it"
(MS to How-Martyn, December 11,
1927 <em>MSM</em> C4:499).</p>
<p>Hans Lehfeldt was likely in
the audience in Charlottenburg-Berlin on December 6, 1927 when
Sanger addressed several hundred
medical and scientific professionals.
It is difficult to confirm when he and
Sanger first met; unfortunately not
all of  Lehfeldt's correspondence has
yet been collected and some,
undoubtedly, was lost or destroyed
when he fled Germany in 1934.
Lehfeldt had returned to Berlin in
1927 after completing post-graduate
studies in Dresden and Vienna.  A
meeting with  Australian-born
gynecologist and British birth
controller, Norman Haire, influenced
Lehfeldt to pursue contraceptive
counseling (Wheeler, p. 298). In
1928 he co-founded and served as
director of the Clinic for Birth
Control and Marriage Counseling in
Charlottenburg under the
sponsorship of the Society for Sexual
Reform. He quickly established
himself as a leading figure in the
National League for Birth Control and Sexual
Hygiene, founded in 1928, and began to compile
research for a comprehensive study on lay sex reform
in Germany that he published in 1932 (Atina
Grossmann, <em>Reforming Sex: The German Movement
for Birth Control & Abortion Reform, 1920-1950,</em>
1995, p. 23).</p>
<p>     Back in Berlin in August of 1929 to further
solidify the clinic movement, Sanger held a
contraceptive seminar for doctors.  Lehfeldt was
invited to the seminar by Dr. Ernst Gr&auml;fenburg
(inventor of the Gr&auml;fenburg ring, an IUD, and better
known posthumously for his rediscovered work on
the Gr&auml;fenburg or "G" spot) to discuss new research
on  intrauterine devices, a method that Sanger
continued to pursue even though it had been widely
discredited by American doctors. </p>
<p>     Lehfeldt and Sanger met again and cemented
their friendship in 1930 at the Seventh International
Birth Control Conference in Zurich.  Sanger
organized the conference of more than a hundred
scientists, physicians and clinicians and wisely
discouraged moral, ethical and political discussions
by restricting participants to purely technical
appraisals of contraceptive techniques and devices,
and a country-by-country review of birth control
work.  The effect was liberating; the participants
proceeded in their meetings without, in Sanger's
words, "shame or prejudice" and with a sense of
"fundamental brotherhood" rather than the "bickerings and disagreements" that characterized
many of the early international birth control and neo-Malthusian conferences (MS, "Introduction to the Proceedings of the Seventh International Birth
Control Conference," 1931, <em>MSM</em> S71:277). Yet
just after the conference Sanger criticized the German
delegates for their propensity to spout theories and
political positions to the detriment of more practical
concerns (MS to Smedley, September 30, 1930, LCM 10:512).</P>
<p>     Hans Lehfeldt's paper at Zurich ran counter
to Sanger's often repeated generalization about the
Germans being wed to theory, not practice.  In "The
Physical and Psychological Aspects of
Contraception" Lehfeldt displayed his gift for
summarizing vast amounts of material taken largely
from his own practice and presenting his findings in
an even-handed, apolitical manner.  He echoed
Sanger's own strong belief that each woman must be
treated individually in a medical setting, preferably by
a doctor, in order to improve safety and increase
effectiveness, but also to insure that reliable records
are preserved on the efficacy of particular methods &ndash;
a point often overlooked by many in the movement
who used "word on the street" determinations in
judging methods rather than hard statistics. He
departed from both Sanger (though he did not
mention her by name) and Britain's birth control
maverick, Marie Stopes, in questioning their
dependence on single methods in their clinics: in
Sanger's case the diaphragm and jelly and for Stopes
a cervical cap combined with the use of quinine.  He
called for much greater individualization, arguing that
other methods such as intrauterine devices, the
condom and even, in some cases, the "safe period,"
paired with a barrier method, proved more effective
and less burdensome for certain women (Hans
Lehfeldt, "The Physical and Psychological Aspects of
Contraception" in <em>The Practice of Contraception: An
International Symposium and Survey</em>, edited by
Margaret Sanger and Hannah M. Stone, 1931, p. 141-9).</p>
<p>     The intimate setting and collegial
atmosphere of Zurich fostered many close
associations, especially among the German
and American delegates who would soon
test the resourcefulness of their friendships
during the Nazi years. Along with Sanger,
Lehfeldt formed bonds with Hannah
Stone, the medical director of Sanger's
Birth Control Clinical Research Bureau in
New York, and her husband, Abraham
Stone, who would assume his wife's
position following her death in 1941.
Beyond the personal and professional
fulfillment that resulted from their
friendship, Sanger and the Stones also
found Lehfeldt to be a willing accomplice
in bootlegging.  For a short time in the
early 1930s, until spring-form diaphragms
were produced in substantial quantities in
the U.S., the Stones arranged to buy
diaphragms through Lehfeldt, along with
several other sources in Europe, and then
smuggled them into the U.S. where it was
still illegal to transport such materials
(Wheeler, p. 298).</p>
<p>     Following Zurich, Lehfeldt wrote
to Sanger in German to update her on the
publication of his Zurich paper and
enclosed "snapshots" taken at the
conference, and the two started a
congenial and, at times, intimate
correspondence &ndash; though they would
remain quite formal and always address each other as
"Dr." and "Mrs."  Later that year Sanger received
Lehfeldt's practical guide to birth control, <em>The Book
of Marriage: A Guide for Men and Women </em>(<em>Das Ehe-Buch</em>) which emphasized the major points Sanger
made in her 1926 marriage manual <em>Happiness in
Marriage</em> and other writings: a reliance on doctor-controlled contraceptive services, an endorsement of
the diaphragm and contraceptive jelly method as the
most effective for
the majority of
women, and the
promotion of
contraception as
the best means to
reduce abortions.
Sanger wrote to
another German
friend about how
"valuable [Lehfeldt's book]
could be to us," but
thought the present
laws in the U.S.
would prevent her
from having it
translated into
English "without
cutting out all that
everyone wants to
know" (MS to
Kate St&uuml;tzin, Jan.  9, 1931, LCM
13:1096).</p>
<p> In the
early 1930s Sanger encouraged her German
associates to centralize birth control activities under
one organization.  In late 1930, with the assistance of
Lehfeldt and several other prominent birth control
doctors, Kate St&uuml;tzin, the wife of a Chilean sexologist
teaching in Berlin, organized the Center for Birth
Control, an umbrella group for all German physicians
involved in birth control.  The aim of the new center
was, according to St&uuml;tzin, to overcome "contrast in
politics, in ethics and in religion [that] prevented
people from working together even in domains where
they agreed," and to enable German birth controllers
to develop a more visible international presence
(Kate St&uuml;tzin,
"Report on
Working
Centre for
Birth
Control,"
November,
1931, LCM 3:1290).  Yet just three years after the
new center was established the victory of the National
Socialist Party in 1933 and the ensuing political and
social upheaval effectively put an end to Weimar sex
reform (Grossmann, pp.43, 136). </p>
<p>     The rise of the Nazis also silenced most of
Sanger's correspondents in Germany, including Lehfeldt.  Both a Jew and a physician engaged in
research on sexuality and fertility control, Lehfeldt
fought personal and professional discrimination and
knew that he could not remain long in Germany after
Hitler came to power.  The Nazis closed down birth
control clinics and sex reform organizations, arrested
several birth control physicians and activists, and
forced many more out of the country.  In 1933
Lehfeldt was arrested and briefly detained by the SS
under charges of  performing abortions.  He was
released, but the inevitability of another arrest and the
threat posed to his fiancé, a non-Jew who would be
persecuted by association, forced Lehfeldt to flee to
the U.S., the country he thought best suited his needs
and insured his freedom.  His fiancé‚ had to wait six
months so as not to risk the threat of arrest for
traveling with a Jew (Wheeler, p. 298). </p>
<p>     Sanger's many friendships and associations
in Germany exposed her to the brutality of the Nazi
regime well before most Americans digested the
incomplete news reports of the day.  "All the news in
Germany is sad & horrible," she wrote Edith How-Martyn in May of 1933, "& to be more dangerous than any other war going on anywhere because it has
so many good people who applaud its atrocities &
claim it's right" (MS to How-Martyn, May 21, 1933, <em>MSM</em> C5:536). Rudolph
Elkan, a physician in
Hamburg and a leader in the German sex reform
movement, wrote to Sanger in late 1933 that "the
Nazis nearly killed me and, after my several injuries
allowed me to walk again." Safely in England he told
Sanger in a postcard:  B.C. is a dangerous hobby and
more so if it becomes a passion" (Rudolph Elkan to
MS, October 12, 1933 and  November 29, 1933, LCM 14:126, 131).  Sanger received similar
reports from a number of Jewish doctors she had
known in Germany, Poland, Austria and Italy.  Later
in the 1930s she would help many of them immigrate
to the U.S., by lining up affidavits required of
sponsoring American citizens, sending money for
passage, using contacts in Washington to cut through
bureaucratic red tape, and to secure employment (see
"Margaret Sanger and the Refugee Department,"
<em>MSPP Newsletter</em> Spring 1993). </p>
<p>     Soon after Lehfeldt arrived in the U.S. he
and Sanger worked together on helping Dr. Ernst
Gr&auml;fenburg.  Lehfeldt had urged Gr&auml;fenburg to leave
Germany with him in 1934, but Gr&auml;fenburg
stubbornly remained to run his thriving private
practice.  He was arrested and imprisoned by the
Gestapo in 1934.  At Lehfeldt's prodding, Sanger
engaged the "refugee department," her secretarial
staff at her New York clinic, to secure Gr&auml;fenburg's
release and bring him to America.  Lehfeldt later
claimed that Sanger "negotiated his [Gr&auml;fenburg's]
release by paying a large ransom," but all parties
were oddly silent on the details of a remarkable
undertaking. Gr&auml;fenburg arrived safely in the States
in 1940 and later worked for a short time as the only
male staff doctor at Sanger's clinic (Lehfeldt,
"Margaret Sanger and the Modern Contraceptive
Techniques," <em>The Journal of Sex Research</em>,
November 1967, 254; Grossmann, p. 153).</p>
<p>     Shortly after Lehfeldt's arrival in the States,
he and Sanger discussed eugenic sterilization, an
issue that had grown far more ponderous and
controversial after Hitler came to power and
instigated a racial hygiene program featuring
sterilization, though the extent of this program was
not yet known.   Lehfeldt enthusiastically endorsed
eugenic sterilization in Weimar Germany and
continued to be a proponent in America, though he
quelled his zealousness for compulsory sterilization,
for obvious reasons, after the war.  Both he and
Sanger advocated a U.S. government sponsored
sterilization program for the "unfit" and "feeble-minded" &ndash; open-ended terms to cover most
psychiatric illnesses and many physical handicaps &ndash;
and those with transmissible congenital diseases.
They also called for the Federal government to
standardize sterilization laws that varied greatly from
state to state.  Like most liberal eugenicists, Sanger
and Lehfeldt sought physical improvement of the
human race, not the elevation of any one racial group
over others.  They believed sterilization policies
would both alleviate human suffering and reduce the
financial burden of the state. </p>
<p>     Hitler had just decreed obligatory
sterilization of the insane in Germany when Lehfeldt
and Sanger talked in 1935.  Lehfeldt viewed the law
as progressive and consistent with Weimar sex
reforms, but Sanger, he reported later, "was deeply
concerned lest the law, enforced by ruthless Nazi
agents, might lead to all sorts of horrible abuses.  Any
opponent of the regime might be declared  insane.'
Later developments in Germany showed how justified
her suspicions had been" (Hans Lehfeldt,
"Sterilization in the U.S.A.," <em>The Journal of Sex
Education</em>, June-July, 1951, p. 260).  As historian
Atina Grossmann writes,  Sanger's cautiousness and
foresight made her "exceptional among watchful
American social hygienists" (Grossmann, 153).</p>
<p>     Lehfeldt's integration into American society,
though successful, was not an easy one.  As a Jew he
faced social and professional discrimination; as a
sexologist he was often ignored &ndash; the field was not
yet taken seriously in America.  And as a socialist and
supporter of homosexual rights and liberal causes he
found himself on the periphery of a conservative and
insular American medical profession, that, in 1935,
still had not taken an official position on the medical
use of contraception.  His support for legalized
abortions distanced him even more from associates,
many of whom did not distinguish between abortion
and contraception. Yet Lehfeldt persevered to open a
successful gynecological practice on Park Avenue
that served patients until 1991 and to establish in
1958, with several other leading sex experts, the
Society for the Scientific Study of Sex, an influential
professional society that opened doors to the field.
Also in 1958 he started a family planning clinic at
Bellevue Hospital. A prolific researcher and writer,
Lehfeldt published widely on all aspects of
contraception, but particularly the cervical cap and
IUD, as well as abortion, and many aspects of sexual
functioning, even though he faced considerable anti-sexuality discrimination in medical publishing (Wheeler, pp. 297, 299).</p>
<p>     Lehfeldt
seemed to have lost
touch with Sanger
during the
immediate post-war
years, though pieces
of their
correspondence may
be missing.  He may
have backed away
from Sanger, whose
public stance (as a
pacifist and a
mother of two draft-age sons) against
U.S. intervention in
the war, alienated
her from several
long-time friends.
But by the early
1950s Lehfeldt and
Sanger renewed
their friendly
correspondence,
exchanged family
news (such as the
birth of Lehfeldt's
first child in 1951),
updates on articles
and conferences, and news of mutual friends. Letters
marking the deaths of Norman Haire in 1952 and
Ernst Gr&auml;fenburg in 1957 brought Sanger and
Lehfeldt ever closer together, the circle of
international birth control pioneers having shrunk to a
frail few. </p>
<p>     In 1951 Lehfeldt wrote Sanger in an
exhilarated mood, declaring a momentous shift in the
birth control movement following the Pope's "defacto
endorsement" of birth control (in the form of the
rhythm method) and the Indian government's
apparent acceptance of it.
<p>


It seems to me that the whole
debate over birth control has now
shifted from the question of
principle to one of method and
improvement.  This indeed is a
great step forward in your fight for
birth control.  It makes me happy to
have fought on your side for almost
25 years (Lehfeldt to MS, Dec. 17, 1951, <em>MSM</em>
S35:752).
<!--msthemelist--></table>

<p>

Sanger, who never gracefully accepted statements of
victory, responded that "the fight for birth control is
certainly not over," and then complained about
renewed Catholic opposition (MS to Lehfeldt, Dec. 28, 1951, <em>MSM</em> S35:868).</p>
<p>   Their friendship was tested in 1953 when
Sanger refrained from publicly supporting Lehfeldt's
plans to start a sex research journal, fearing that it
would detract from her singular identity as a birth
control crusader. She wrote him in 1953, following
his request that she serve on an advisory board for
<em>The Journal of  Sexual Science</em>:
<p>



As you doubtless know, I am one
who does not spread my interests
over many fields, mainly perhaps,
because I have so concentrated my
studies and interest in the problems
of Birth Control and population.
This does not mean that I have no
interest in sex psychology. . . .  I
still feel, however, that the
International Planned
Parenthood Movement
will take my entire time . .
. (MS to Hans Lehfeldt,
May 8, 1953, LCM,
9:122).
<!--msthemelist--></table>

<p>Nevertheless, she gave Lehfeldt contacts for raising
money and advice on maneuvering around anti-obscenity laws. Lehfeldt seemed grateful for any assistance Sanger offered, and continued to ask  her
to join boards and committees, inviting her in 1957,
for instance, to be a charter member of the Society for
the Scientific Study of Sex.  She again declined,
citing the same reasons as before.  Finally in 1960,
after several more entreaties from Lehfeldt, Sanger
offered a written endorsement for another version of
the journal he failed to get off the ground in 1953,
now titled the <em>Journal of Sexual Research</em> (MS to Lehfeldt, Dec. 20, 1957 and
Jan. 21, 1960,
<em>MSM</em> S53:126; S56:504).</p>
<p>     By this point in Sanger's career, there were
few physicians in the birth control movement who
continued to confide in her or seek her opinion. Many
doctors discounted Sanger's influence in the
American birth control movement after the second
World War, when she focused her attention overseas
to the formation of the International Planned
Parenthood Federation.  In fact, in a 1959 article
written by Alan Guttmacher, the head of obstetrics at
Mt Sinai Hospital in New York, and a leading figure
in the post-war movement in the U.S., he referred to
"the late" Margaret Sanger (she died in 1966),
much to her horror.
The
mistake
may not
have
been entirely accidental.  Margaret Sanger's
necessary convergence with the American medical
profession in the 1920s created a troublesome
marriage of strong-wills and political
incompatibilities. Sanger's frustration with medicos
and the medical professionalization of the birth
control movement contributed to her resolve in the
late 1920s to focus more intently on international
work and the hope of discovering new contraceptives
abroad.<p>     If Sanger's union with American doctors
was a cautious, edgy marriage then her relationship
with sympathetic doctors in Europe, and Germany in
particular, was a liberating affair.  European doctors
generally did not feel threatened, as did many
American doctors, by Sanger's call for clinics, and
they usually welcomed the publicity she brought to
the issue. A considerable number of  birth control emigres during the war also owed Sanger a debt of
gratitude for her efforts to facilitate their passage to
the U.S. and assist them with finding employment.
Yet, over time, many of her international
relationships also soured due to such practical
problems as language barriers (Sanger only spoke and
read English), and Sanger's paranoia over threats,
real and perceived, to her leadership of the
international movement.  She lost touch or parted
ways with a roster of leading international birth
control figures, including Marie Stopes, Grafenburg
(after his short stint at Sanger's clinic where Sanger
prohibited him, the world expert on IUD's, from
prescribing the devices), and Helena Wright, the
English sexologist, to name a few.</p>
<p>     Lehfeldt, however, worked carefully at his
friendship with Sanger.  He both charmed and
engaged  her, and made sure to credit her whenever
appropriate.  He never took liberties with her stature
or used her name without permission.  He was tactful
and exceedingly polite.  Instead of bluntly criticizing
her tendency to oversimplify medical statistics, or fall
back on obsolete research, he would send technical
material, often his own articles, to bring her up to
speed.  As he did with many of his German
colleagues from the late 1920s and 1930s, Lehfeldt
worked at keeping his association with Sanger current
and cordial, even sending birthday greetings on
occasion. Sanger, in turn, learned to value his
opinion, asking, for instance, his advice on
International Planned Parenthood Federation matters
of the greatest importance, such as who should
succeed her as president.  She especially appreciated
his attention during the later years when so few
doctors sought to continue a dialog with her.</p>
<p>     Much of their later correspondence
discussed specific contraceptives, particularly the
cervical cap, which Lehfeldt demonstrated in 1954
was as reliable a contraceptive as the diaphragm, and
therefore should be more widely offered to increase
women's choice. Sanger was elated over Lehfeldt's
findings and thought his work might convince clinics
to reintroduce the cervical cap, long abandoned by
many doctors due to patient complaints over fitting
problems. Sanger had pressed for the use of the cap
early on when diaphragms were particularly difficult
to obtain:
<p>


This, as you doubtless know, was
the first mechanical device that I
brought over from France, back as
far as 1912 or 1913, when I went
over to study the French methods. It
was also, by the way, this little cap
that used to be shipped to American
purchasers under the guise of
bonbons from France . . . (MS to
Lehfeldt, Jan. 14, 1954, <em>MSM</em> S42:578-9).
<!--msthemelist--></table>

<p>     Lehfeldt also kept Sanger apprised of a
research study he conducted at the Bellevue
Contraceptive Clinic on Enovid, the first patented
version of the anovulant pill that represented the
breakthrough contraceptive that both had long
worked for.  Years later, when many claimed to have
a hand in the birth of "the pill," but generally
overlooked Sanger's important role (she kept the
idea alive for decades and arranged the initial
funding for its development), Lehfeldt was one of
the few medical men to give Sanger adequate credit.</p>
<p>     In 1961, the last productive year of
Sanger's life before various health problems
necessitated constant medical care, Sanger and
Lehfeldt met for the last time at a "World Tribute"
dinner to honor Sanger in New York.  He wrote to
her a short time later about how pleased he was to
see her "still carrying on the fight for Birth Control,
the beginnings of which I am proud to have
witnessed."  "Yes," she scribbled in a wobbly hand,
"you have been a devoted friend of our cause and I
welcome you" (Lehfeldt to MS, May 25, 1961 and
MS to Lehfeldt, May, 1961, <em>MSM</em> S58:871-2).
The word "welcome" was surely the small error of
an ageing mind; Sanger meant to say "thank."  But
in some ways she was welcoming him, as no one
had properly done in 1935, and ushering him in as
one of the chosen few to carry on her legacy &ndash;
which is exactly what he did for some thirty more
years until his death on June 18, 1993. </p>
