<h1>"Charlotte Perkins Gilman: Tribute to Birth Control"</h1>

<p><em>In February of 1935, Margaret Sanger celebrated the 21st anniversary of the
birth control movement by holding a "Birth Control Comes of Age Dinner," in
Washington DC.  Many prominent individuals attended and/or sent statements
congratulating Sanger on her achievement.  Among them was feminist writer Charlotte
Perkins Gilman, who could not attend, but sent the following poem (Gilman to MS,
Feb. 7, 1935, LCM,44:16):</em></p>

<p>FOR BIRTH CONTROL</p>

<p>For Birth Control; for mothers free<br />
To bear strong children willingly<br />
And rear them well; not as before<br />
Theirs and their children's lives to pour    <br />
In needless death and misery.</p>

<p>Who stands against us?  Those who see<br />
Gain in unchecked fecundity &ndash;<br />
Not better children &ndash; only more<br />
No Birth Control</p>

<p>For mothers in whose power shall be<br />
The lifting of humanity &ndash;<br />
A world of improving more and more &ndash;<br />
A world at peace from shore to shore &ndash;<br />
This is the reason and the plea<br />
For Birth Control.</p>
