<p>The Margaret Sanger Papers Project is a historical editing project initially sponsored by the <a href="https://as.nyu.edu/history.html">Department of History</a> and
  then by the <a href="https://www.library.nyu.edu">Division of Libraries</a> at <a href="https://www.nyu/edu">New York University</a>. The Project was formed
  by <a href="{% link project/esther_katz.html %}">Dr. Esther Katz</a> in 1985 to locate, arrange, edit, research, and publish the papers of the
  noted birth control pioneer.</p>

<p>The Margaret Sanger Papers Project has published a two-series microfilm edition, the <i><a href="{% link publications/microfilm.html %}">Margaret Sanger Papers Microfilm,</a></i>
  <a href="{% link publications/smith_series.html %}">Smith College Collections</a> and the
  <a href="{% link publications/collecteddocuments.html %}">Collected Documents Series</a>. Work on the Smith College Collections entailed the
  rearrangement and organization of over 50,000 Sanger documents in the Margaret Sanger collection and seventeen other collections at the Sophia Smith Collection and
  Smith College Archives. Work on the Collected Documents Series included a ten-year international search of over 1,500 archives and private collections, photocopying
  material and organizing over 9,000 documents for publication. Both series have been published with a printed reel guide that includes an item-level index by University Publications
  of America, now a division of <a href="https://about.proquest.com/en/products-services/microform/">Proquest</a>. On online edition of the Project's microfilm is available through Proquest's
  <a href="http://proquest.libguides.com/historyvault/sanger">History Vault</a></p>

    Illinois Press</a>. The volumes are subtitled <i><a href="{% link publications/volume_i.html %}">The Woman Rebel, 1900-1928</a></i>, <i><a href="{% link publications/volume_ii.html %}">Birth Control Comes of Age, 1928-1939</a></i>,
