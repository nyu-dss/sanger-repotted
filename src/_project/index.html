<p>The Margaret Sanger Papers Project is a historical editing project initially sponsored by the <a href="https://as.nyu.edu/history.html">Department of History</a> and
  then by the <a href="https://www.library.nyu.edu">Division of Libraries</a> at <a href="https://www.nyu/edu">New York University</a>. The Project was formed
  by <a href="{% link _project/esther_katz.html %}">Dr. Esther Katz</a> in 1985 to locate, arrange, edit, research, and publish the papers of the
  noted birth control pioneer.</p>

<p>The Margaret Sanger Papers Project has published a two-series microfilm edition, the <i><a href="{% link _publications/microfilm.html %}">Margaret Sanger Papers Microfilm,</a></i>
  <a href="{% link _publications/smith_series.html %}">Smith College Collections</a> and the
  <a href="{% link _publications/collected_documents.html %}">Collected Documents Series</a>. Work on the Smith College Collections entailed the
  rearrangement and organization of over 50,000 Sanger documents in the Margaret Sanger collection and seventeen other collections at the Sophia Smith Collection and
  Smith College Archives. Work on the Collected Documents Series included a ten-year international search of over 1,500 archives and private collections, photocopying
  material and organizing over 9,000 documents for publication. Both series have been published with a printed reel guide that includes an item-level index by University Publications
  of America, now a division of <a href="https://www.proquest.com/">Proquest</a>. On online edition of the Project's micorfilm is available through Proquest's
  <a href="http://proquest.libguides.com/historyvault/sanger">History Vault</a></p>

<p>The Project has completed a four-volume book edition of Sanger's Papers, published by the <a href="http://www.press.uillinois.edu/" target="_new">University of
    Illinois Press</a>. The volumes are subtitled <i><a href="{% link _publications/volume_i.html %}">The Woman Rebel, 1900-1928</a></i>, <i><a href="{% link _publications/volume_ii.html %}">Birth Control Comes of Age, 1928-1939</a></i>,
  <a href="{% link _publications/volume_iii.html %}">The Politics of Parenthood, 1939-1966</a></i>, and <i><a href="{% link _publications/volume_iv.html %}">'Round the World for Birth Control,' 1920-1959</a>,</i> have been published.</p>

<p>The Project also published an electronic edition of a small sample of documents related to Sanger's <a href="{% link _documents/mswomanrebel.html %}">The Woman Rebel</a>.</p>
