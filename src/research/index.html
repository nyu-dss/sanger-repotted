The Margaret Sanger Papers Project's primary goal is to publish material about Margaret Sanger in microfilm, book, and electronic forms. We are neither an archive
nor a research library and we do not own any of the collections of Sanger's original papers. Moreover, as we no longer maintain an office, we do not have the facilities or staff to
copy documents or undertake extensive research. We do try to respond to all queries, but if you require detailed or time-consuming research we will try to direct you towards
researchers who might be willing to undertake the work.
