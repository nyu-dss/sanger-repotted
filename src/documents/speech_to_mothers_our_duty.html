<h2>"TO MOTHERS - OUR DUTY"
<br />By Margaret H. Sanger</h2>

<p align="left">[<span class="italicText">March 26, 1911</span>]<br /></p>
<p>

In this day and age, when women are striving to their utmost to compete with their sisters in matters of dress, fashion, in

"bridge," or anything which offers amusement or diversion from the old routine of our mothers' day, we hear a great deal from

the male element about "Woman's Duty." This question of "duty" seems to be a stickler, and seems to confine itself to woman<br />

only.</p>



<p>This "duty," so called, means that women should remain at home, not necessarily to drudge -- not at all -- for among those

women referred to above, the servant question forms a large part of their conversation; but "duty" means the care of the home,

of the children -- the problem of feeding them carefully (even scientifically), of making their little bodies strong and robust, in

fact, of giving them a good foundation mentally and physically -- for life.

</p>



<p>Most men think a woman's duty is done when she attends to these needs of her children, but to me she has but begun to do her

duty.</p>



<p>Let us take a young woman in the most ideal conditions of this life; she has given much thought and consideration to the life of

her boy long before he was born, her every thought for almost a year was this child. He now comes into the world a rosy,

healthy being, and she feels proud her work is so well begun; and she may well be proud.</p>



<p>Then follow the years of care. Every conceivable attention, mental and moral, she gives him; his childhood, his boyhood, is one

joyous song of the pleasures of living, and after years of these joys he emerges into manhood. He is now ready for the great

battle of life.</p>



<p>This mother has done her duty, and she sends him forth, clean, honest, moral, to get his living, but has she ever given the manner

in which he is to obtain that living a thought? That is considered outside woman's "duty."</p>



<p>We women can build them up, these bodies and minds, build them up to our highest expectations and then push them out upon

a world whose system is greed, exploitation, graft and scientific robbery.</p>



<p>Can we expect these morals to stay built up in these corrupt surroundings? As this case is an ideal one, so it is an exceptional

one; let us turn, then, to one which is no exception.</p>



<p>This is the case of the most abused, most dejected, most imposed upon class of mothers which our social system presents to us,

and their number is legion.</p>



<p>Here we find the little mothers at 8, 9 and 10 years of age; here we see them already at work carrying responsibilities of the

home, factory or mill; education is a thing apart from this child, childhood yearnings are crushed, childish joys are barred here,

there is time for but one thing -- work. Work through childhood, through girlhood and womanhood.</p>



<p>We follow this child-mother up to the marriage day and find she has given her childhood, girlhood, womanhood, her strength,

her very life to the factory or mill for an existence, an existence which the owner of the factory would not allow his horse or dog.

Her face is pale and pinched with that hunting look of poverty; it never changes -- she is born, lives and dies with that look. She

is married at night after the day's work, that she lose not one day's time.</p>



<p>On, on in the same monotonous way; on, on, waiting for the end.</p>



<p>There's no time for her to think of the little one's coming; she must work only the harder because of its coming.</p>



<p>After months of worry, toil, privation and physical exhaustion this child, too, is born. Let us see what this woman gives to

society. Her child is undersized, underfed, weak, sickly and ofttimes deformed. It, too, has paid the price of birth;

it has given its little strength with every heartbeat, that it may be born, and now it is here, cheated and swindled of its birthright.</p>



<p>Women, women, arouse yourselves! If you are not so unfortunately placed, it is but a trick of circumstances.</p>



<p>If you are well clothed, well fed, today it is these women who have helped you to do so. And are you doing anything for these

women? Ministers of the Gospel, what are you doing for these women and unborn babies? You reformers, conservatives, call

yourselves what you wish, what are you doing for this condition of society which demands of its unborn such an awful price of

birth? Do you think your duty is done if you have clothed or fed one or fifty of these victims for a day, a week, a year, perhaps?

Oh, mothers, sisters, women of this land, awake! How can you slumber when these conditions exist?</p>



<p>The day is passed when we can selfishly protect our own. In order to protect our own, in matters of disease, in conditions

where milk, water, food or drugs are unsafe for our own loved ones, we cannot hesitate to fight for all, for we realize we can

only save our own by so doing.</p>



<p>Again I say: Women, awake, awake to this system and help these downtrodden women back to their homes, back to their little

ones, back to that which belongs to every mother -- the care and love of her offspring.</p>



<p>By the way, do we ever hear the male element, who so strongly advocate "home duty" for the "bridge" mother, advocate home

duty for these women? It is only the "bridge" women's children who need the care and attention of the mother, evidently.</p>



<p>Let us turn to the mother we have just beheld with her new-born infant. What is to be done with this subnormal piece of

humanity? Does it not need even more care and attention than a normal child? But what does it get? Dire poverty drives this

mother back again to the factory (no intelligent person will say she goes willingly). It is the fear of the loss of a job, debts and

another mouth to feed that compels her to leave this newborn infant in the care of any one who has the room to keep it. Any

friend or neighbor who works at home can take care of this little waif.</p>



<p>We all know the type -- hard working, ignorant, with scarcely time to attend to the actual needs of her own.</p>



<p>The little one is placed here among the filth and debris of the workshop. It grows through babyhood and childhood motherless,

fatherless and moral-less.</p>



<p>Of course, there are other alternatives, such as the charity kindergartens, but always the mother on the industrial field is cheated

of love and care of her offspring.</p>



<p>In this age of Christianity, in this advanced twentieth century, when science has discovered the methods of breeding the finest

horses and dogs, when science has turned its searchlight upon every form of plant life; upon the

different parasites which tend to destroy plant life, what has it done toward extricating the parasite poverty, which destroys humanity? Senator Owen, of

Oklahoma, said recently:</p>



<p>"We spend $500,000 to exterminate the insect that eats the cotton plant. . . . We have millions for conservation of the forests.

Our Senators and Representatives jump to their feet the minute one mentions raising the tariff on wool or on steel, but we can

get no such interest when it comes to saving human lives."</p>



<p>Look at the health report for the past three years and see the loss of children in New York City alone:</p>

<p>Or 48,420 little infants under one year of age and 72,926 children under five, all in three years. What a shameful slaughter!

What a cowardly and selfish people to allow these modern Herods, Poverty and Ignorance, deliberately and silently to do away

with this army of innocent and helpless babies!</p>



<p>Why should these countless fathers and mothers, almost one million times greater in number, surrender to these few monster

exploiters -- to this Capitalistic System which bases its existence on the fiendish exploitation, and ultimate murder of these

children?</p>



<p>We do not wonder such a small percentage of these children attain the age of puberty. Yet the manufacturer knows that his

material must be well made, strong and firm; he knows the stronger and firmer it is woven, the better it will stand the wear and

tear. Again, the tailor knows it takes time and care to make of this material a nicely shaped dress or coat, and if used before it's

ready it will not be so serviceable.</p>



<p>If man would do his duty to Human Beings, as well as he does to Things, we

[<span class="italicText">would</span>] have no need of leaving the little ones to the care of strangers all day. We would have no need of giving our babies' lives to the factory before they are born. We would

have no need of seeing our little ones grow up in mental, moral, and physical starvation. We would have no need of suffering the

awful pangs, of seeing them go out of the world, so soon, pangs which are so much keener than those which bring them here.

All these and a thousand other sufferings and evils could be stamped out if man would do his duty.</p>



<p>There are two steps toward progress in this universe -- organization and specialization. Mothers, let us not consider we are

progressing. Let us not consider we have done our duty, until we have first organized. Then let us specialize in attacking and

stamping out this social system.</p>



<p>We must organize -- all women who have one vestige of love in our hearts, for children; all women who have interest in the

progress of humanity; all should organize, but not alone.</p>



<p>We should organize under a banner which advocates our cause. We should join the party (there is but one, the Socialist party)

which solves the problems of each and every grievance of these working women and children.</p>



<p>First, we should demand through this party absolute equality of the sexes.</p>



<p>Second, to put back the mothers or the prospective mothers, into the homes, and give her a pension sufficient to keep herself

and child. I can hear wails of protest concerning this last demand, on the ground that it will make vagrants of the fathers or will

give them more time and money for saloons. All I can ask is that you look into this, find out what has been done, and the results

you will find will remove that argument completely. It has been the experience of those interested in this, that when a man feels

his burdens partly lifted, he is mentally and physically better fitted for life's work.</p>



<p>Third, to support and educate the children, and by support we mean clearly to feed and clothe them, until they are at least 16

years of age.</p>



<p>Fourth, to keep every child, regardless of race, color, or creed, in this United States out of all factories, mills and all industrial

fields which tend to dwarf the physical or mental development of the children.</p>



<p>Last, to pull down completely this system, which mangles and stunts the minds, morals and bodies of our boys and men; to fight

this awful viper, which undoes all our life's work, to crush and stamp it out forever. This, mothers, is a duty which must go hand

in hand with our every day duties, or our life's work will be all for nothing.</p>
