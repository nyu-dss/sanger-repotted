Below are links to scholarly sites that have mounted documents (either
transcriptions or digital images) written by Margaret Sanger. The Project
has not proofread these documents, and is not responsible for the quality
of the work. Any questions about them should be directed to the host sites.
Note that the documents on some of these sites are not necessarily the
first or only version of articles or pamphlets. For full information on
the various editions of Sanger's writings, see our microfilm. <a href="http://books.google.com/">Google Books</a> also may have full or limited access to Sanger authored books.
