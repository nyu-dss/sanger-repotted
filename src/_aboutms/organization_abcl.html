<h1>American Birth Control League</h1>
<h2>History</h2>

<p>Margaret Sanger founded the American Birth Control League (ABCL) on November 10, 1921 at the First American Birth Control Conference in New York City.  She
established the ABCL to offer an ambitious program of education, legislative reform,
and research that would supersede the work of Mary Ware Dennett's Voluntary
Parenthood League, the successor to the National Birth Control League.  Her goal was
to build a truly national organization with representation in every region of the country.
The staff and board of directors of the ABCL grew directly out of <i><a href="organization_bcr.html">The Birth Control Review</a></i>, the monthly journal Sanger launched in 1917. In 1923, the ABCL took over
publication of <i>The Birth Control Review</i> from the New York Women's Publishing
Company.</p>

<P>During Sanger's tenure as president, the ABCL focused on disseminating birth control information to doctors, social workers, women's clubs, and the scientific
community, as well as to thousands of individual women; fostering the  development
of state and local birth control leagues and clinics; and lobbying at the state and
national level for birth control legislation.  A large part of the ABCL's activities
involved the organization of conferences and public meetings on birth control.   The
League operated with the support of a national council composed of physicians,
scientists, and prominent New York-area society women.  By 1926 the ABCL also
received support from over 37,000 general members.  Members paid $1.00 to join and
were often asked to support the ABCL's legislative initiatives by writing to their state
and Congressional representatives.</P>

<p>The first legal birth control clinic in the U.S., the Clinical Research Bureau (CRB),
opened in 1923 under the auspices of the ABCL.  The clinic provided married women
and couples with contraceptive services, including counselling and follow-up visits.
Most women were fitted with pessaries or diaphragms to be used with a contraceptive
jelly.  The clinic kept extensive patient records to be used for research and to
demonstrate the effectiveness and safety of a doctor-staffed, contraceptive program.
The CRB served as the medical arm of the ABCL, conducting research and testing on
a variety of contraceptives and medical practices related to reproduction, and
responding to queries from women, doctors and other clinics throughout the country.
The largest birth control clinic in the country, the CRB served as a model for the
establishment of doctor-staffed clinics across the nation.  Although Sanger maintained
the clinic as a largely independent entity, the CRB reported to the Board of Directors
of the ABCL and received part of its operating budget from ABCL resources.  </p>

<p>Sanger served as president from 1921 until her resignation on June 12, 1928
over administrative differences with Acting President Eleanor Dwight Jones, a desire
to concentrate on birth control research and clinical service at the CRB, and her
increased interest in international work.  After her resignation, Sanger assumed full
control of the CRB, renaming it the <a href="organization_bccrb.html">Birth Control Clinical Research Bureau</a> (BCCRB), and severed all legal ties with the ABCL.  In 1939, the ABCL merged with the BCCRB to form the <a href="organization_bcfa.html">Birth Control Federation of America,</a> which in 1942 changed its name to the <a href="organization_ppfa.html">Planned Parenthood Federation of America</a>.</p>

<h2>Organizational Structure</h2>

<p><b>Advisory Board/Consulting Committee</b><br />
Consisted of physicians who primarily advised the Clinical Research Bureau on medical issues and represented the clinic within the medical community.</p>

<p><b>Board of Directors</b><br />
Approximately 15 members who oversaw all facets of the organization and elected an Executive Committee to supervise operations.</p>

<p><b>Clinical Research Bureau (CRB)</b><br />
Founded in 1923, the CRB was directed by a woman physician (Dr. Dorothy Bocker, followed by Dr. Hannah Stone), and maintained a Medical Advisory Board.  When Margaret Sanger resigned the presidency of the ABCL in 1928, she asserted full and independent control of the clinic, renaming it the Birth Control Clinical Research Bureau.  In 1925, Bureau operated a clinic in the predominately African-American midtown neighborhood of Columbus Hill, which remained opened just three months.  In 1926, the CRB also opened a Brooklyn clinic which lasted nine months.</p>

<p><b>Conference Committees</b><br />
Committees formed for each of the conferences sponsored by the ABCL. Various officers and members of the national council participated in organizing and funding the conferences.</p>

<p><b>Congressional Committee</b><br />
Founded in 1926, the Congressional Committee lobbied Congress and other organizations for a federal birth control bill.  State lobbying was also undertaken in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and California.</p>

<p><b>Education Department</b><br />
Supervised the Publications Department, the Book Department, and the Margaret Sanger Lecture Bureau. It launched various education programs, and helped to organize conferences, and mass mailings.</p>

<p><b>Executive Committee</b><br />
Comprised of ABCL officers (president, vice-presidents, treasurer), and selected members of the Board of Directors, the Executive Committee was empowered to oversee daily operations of the ABCL.</p>

<p><b>Margaret Sanger Lecture Bureau</b><br />
Later called simply the Lecture Bureau, this department arranged for lectures on birth control by Margaret Sanger, James F. Cooper, and other members of the ABCL staff.</p>

<p><b>Motherhood Advice Bureau (MAB)/Motherhood Department</b><br />
The MAB was established to answer the thousands of letters received by Margaret Sanger requesting birth control information.</p>

<p><b>National Council</b><br />
A group of prominent socialites, religious leaders and physicians recruited by Sanger to provide respectability and advice to the ABCL.  National Committee members had few formal duties but occasionally advised and assisted Sanger on policy questions and fundraising.</p>

<p><b>Publications Department (including the Book Department)</b><br />
Responsible for the publication of <i>The Birth Control Review</i>, processing orders for ABCL publications and for Sanger's books, and dispatching press releases.</p>
