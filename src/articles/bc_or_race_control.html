title: "Birth Control or Race Control? Sanger and the Negro Project"
---

<p>The Negro Project, instigated in 1939 by Margaret Sanger, was one of the first major undertakings of the new Birth Control Federation
of America (BCFA), the product of a merger between the American Birth Control League and Sanger's Birth Control Clinical Research Bureau, and one of
the more controversial campaigns of the birth control movement. Developed by white birth control reformers, who consulted with African-Americans
for help in promoting the project only well after its inception, the Negro Project and associated campaigns were, nevertheless, widely supported by
such black leaders as Mary McLeod Bethune, W. E. B. DuBois, and Rev. Adam Clayton Powell, Jr. Influenced strongly by both the eugenics movement
and the progressive welfare programs of the New Deal era, the Negro Project
was, from the start, largely indifferent to the needs of the black community
and constructed in terms and with perceptions that today smack of racism.</p><p>
What it became was not the project Sanger had first envisioned.
As she wrote in an initial fund-raising request to Albert Lasker, the wealthy
advertising executive just beginning his post-business career in medical
philanthropy, she simply hoped to help &quot;a group notoriously underprivileged
and handicapped to a large measure by a â€˜caste' system that operates as
an added weight upon their efforts to get a fair share of the better things
in life. To give them the means of helping themselves is perhaps
the richest gift of all. We believe birth control knowledge brought
to this group, is the most direct, constructive aid that can be given them
to improve their immediate situation.&quot; Sanger viewed the Negro Project
as another effort to help African-Americans gain better access to safe
contraception and maintain birth control services in their community as
she had attempted to do in Harlem a decade earlier when Sanger's Birth
Control Clinical Research Bureau (BCCRB), in cooperation with the New York
Urban League, opened a birth control clinic there. (MS to Lasker,
July 10, 1939, Mary Lasker Papers, Columbia University (to be microfilmed
in a later addendum to the MSM)</p>
<p> By the late 1930s, the birth control activists began to focus
on high birth rates and poor quality of life in the South, alerted to alarming
Southern poverty by a 1938 U.S. National Resource Committee report which
asserted that Southern poverty drained resources from other parts of the
country. Starting in the mid-1930s, Sanger sent field workers into
the rural South to establish birth control services in poor communities
and conduct research. She sought to test various contraceptive jellies
and foam powders to see if they could effectively be used without a diaphragm,
which would be cheaper and easier for poor women to use. Physician
and philanthropist Clarence Gamble (1894-1966), who was on a quest
to find the best birth control for the &quot;uneducated masses,&quot; funded and
supervised several of these rural Southern projects. The birth control
movement also looked to Southern states as the ideal region in which to
secure funding under New Deal legislation and to establish birth control
services as part of state and federal public health programs. These
birth control initiatives were designed, in part, to demonstrate to government
bureaucrats on the county, state and federal levels that contraceptive
clinics were essential in impoverished Southern communities and could be
successfully duplicated in other regions.</p>
<p> In 1937, North Carolina became the first state to incorporate
birth control services into a statewide public health program, followed
by six other southern states. However, these successes were clouded by
the failure of birth controllers to overcome segregated health services
and improve African-Americans' access to contraceptives. Hazel Moore,
a veteran lobbyist and health administrator, ran a birth control project
under Sanger's direction and found that black women in several Virginia
counties were very responsive to birth control education. A 1938
trip to Tennessee further convinced Sanger of the desire of African-Americans
in that region to control their fertility and the need for specific programs
in birth control education aimed at the black community. (Hazel Moore,
&quot;Birth Control for the Negro,&quot; 1937, Sophia Smith Collection, Florence
Rose Papers.)</p>
<p>In 1939 Sanger teamed with Mary Woodward Reinhardt, secretary
of the newly formed BCFA, to secure a large donor to fund an educational
campaign to teach African-American women in the South about contraception.
Sanger, Reinhardt and Sanger's secretary, Florence Rose, drafted a report
on &quot;Birth Control and the Negro,&quot; skillfully using language that appealed
both to eugenicists fearful of unchecked black fertility and progressives
committed to shepherding African-Americans into middle-class culture. The
report stated that &quot;[N]egroes present the great problem of the South,&quot;
as they are the group with &quot;the greatest economic, health and social problems,&quot;
and outlined a practical birth control program geared toward a population
characterized as largely illiterate and that &quot;still breed carelessly and
disastrously,&quot; a line borrowed from a June 1932 Birth Control Review article
by W.E.B. DuBois. Armed with this paper, Reinhardt initiated contact
between Sanger and Albert Lasker (soon to be Reinhardt's husband), who
pledged $20,000 starting in Nov. 1939. (&quot;Birth Control and
the Negro,&quot; July 1939, Lasker Papers)</p>
<p> However, once funding was secured, the project slipped from
Sanger's hands. She had proposed that the money go to train &quot;an up
and doing modern minister, colored, and an up and doing modern colored
medical man&quot; at her New York clinic who would then tour &quot;as many Southern
cities and organizations and churches and medical societies as they can
get before&quot; and &quot;preach and preach and preach!&quot; She believed that after
a year of such &quot;educational agitation&quot; the Federation could support a &quot;practical
campaign for supplying mothers with contraceptives.&quot; Before going
in and establishing clinics, Sanger thought it critical to gain the support
and involvement of the African-American community (not just its leaders)
and establish a foundation of trust. Her proposal derived from the
work of activists in the field, discussions with black leaders and her
experience with the New York clinics. Sanger understood the concerns
of some within the black community about having Northern whites intervene
in the most intimate aspect of their lives. &quot;I do not believe&quot; she
warned, &quot;that this project should be directed or run by white medical men.
The Federation should direct it with the guidance and assistance of the
colored group &amp;ndash; perhaps, particularly and specifically formed for the
purpose.&quot; To succeed, she wrote, &quot;It takes a very strong heart and
an individual well entrenched in the community. . . .&quot; (MS to Gamble, Nov.
26, 1939, and MS to Robert Seibels, Feb. 12, 1940 [MSM S17:514,
891].)</p>
<p> Sanger reiterated the need for black ministers to head up the
project in a letter to Clarence Gamble in Dec. 1939, arguing that: &quot;We
do not want word to go out that we want to exterminate the Negro population
and the minister is the man who can straighten out that idea if it ever
occurs to any of their more rebellious members.&quot; This passage
has been repeatedly extracted by Sanger's detractors as evidence that she
led a calculated effort to reduce the black population against their will.
From African-American activist Angela Davis on the left to conservative
commentator Dinesh D'Souza on the right, this statement alone has condemned
Sanger to a perpetual waltz with Hitler and the KKK. Davis quoted
the incendiary passage in her 1983 Women, Race and Class, claiming that
the Negro Project &quot;confirmed the ideological victory of the racism associated
with eugenic ideas.&quot; D'Souza used the quote to buttress erroneous
claims that Sanger called blacks &quot;human weeds&quot; and a &quot;menace to civilization&quot;
in his best-selling 1995 book The End of Racism. The argument that
Sanger co-opted black clergy and community leaders to exterminate their
own race not only gives Sanger unwarranted credit as a remarkably cunning
manipulator, but also suggests that African-Americans were passive receptors
of birth control reform, incapable of making their own decisions about
family size; and that black leaders were ignorant and gullible.</p>
<p> In the end, Sanger's plan for an educational campaign to precede
the demonstration project lost out to the white medical and public relations
men running the new Federation. They were particularly swayed by
Robert Seibels (1890-1955), chairman of the Committee on Maternal Welfare
of the South Carolina Medical Association, who was chosen by the BCFA to
direct a Negro demonstration project in that state. Seibels distrusted
Sanger and her loyal crew of field workers, calling them &quot;dried-up female
fanatics&quot; who had the gall to tell doctors what to do. Robert E. Seibels
to Frederick C. Holden, Jan. 28, 1939, Sophia Smith Collection, Records
of PPFA.) He saw no need for prerequisite education and propaganda
and advised incorporating birth control services for blacks into a general
public health program. The BCFA then dismissed the notion of building
a community-based, black-staffed demonstration clinic that could become
permanent, and instead set in motion a plan that closely resembled the
vaccination and VD caravans that swept in and out of the region.</p>
<p>Lasker's money was used to set up demonstration projects between
1940 and 1942 in several rural South Carolina counties, under Seibels's
direction, and in urban Nashville, TN under the auspices of the Nashville
City Health Department. In South Carolina, the BCFA hired two African-American
nurses to make house calls and meet with women in groups at schools and
community centers to encourage them to visit a clinic, but contraceptives
were dispensed by white doctors only. In Nashville, demonstration
clinics were opened at the Bethlehem Center, a black settlement house,
and later at Fisk University, and black nurses were eventually employed
with some success there as well.</p>
<p> The Federation immediately claimed that the Negro Project had
exceeded its expectations and even persuaded Life Magazine to carry a photo
spread of the demonstration clinics in South Carolina in May 1940.
But relatively few women, (only about 3,000) visited the demonstration
clinics to receive contraceptive instruction. And among those that
did, the dropout rates were high as many women would not return to white
doctors for follow-up exams, though the black nurses in both Nashville
and South Carolina met with greater success. In 1942 the Federation
ended funding for the demonstration clinics claiming to have developed
&quot;workable procedures&quot; for providing contraception to African-Americans
in both rural and urban communities; but no other clinics appear to have
opened as a result of the Project. (&quot;Better Health for 13,000,000,&quot; PPFA
Report, April 16, 1943, Rose Papers; John Overton, &quot;A Birth Control Service
Among Urban Negroes,&quot; Human Fertility, Aug. 1942, 97-101.)</p>
<p> However, the &quot;Division of Negro Service,&quot; a department created
at the BCFA initially to oversee the Negro Project, did implement some
of the educational goals Sanger outlined. Under the direction of
Florence Rose, with money raised by Sanger, and inspired by an advisory
council of eminent black leaders, educators and health professionals, the
Division undertook significant education projects from 1940-1943.
Rose flooded every black organization in the country with planned parenthood
literature, set up exhibits, instigated local and national press coverage
and hired a black woman doctor, Mae McCarroll, to teach birth control techniques
to black doctors and lobby medical groups. Though still stinging
from the rejection of her earlier proposal for the Negro Project, Sanger
wrote enthusiastically to Albert Lasker in July of 1942 about what she
now framed as a pioneering effort: &quot;I believe that the Negro question is
coming definitely to the fore in America, not only because of the war,
but in anticipation of the place the Negro will occupy after the peace.
I think it is magnificent that we are in on the ground floor, helping Negroes
to control their birth rate, to reduce their high infant and maternal death
rate, to maintain better standards of health and living for those already
born, and to create better opportunities for those who will be born.
In other words, we're giving Negroes an opportunity to help themselves,
and to rise to their own heights through education and the principles of
a democracy.&quot; (MS to Lasker, July 9, 1942, MSM S21:404)
</p><p> But the BCFA (which changed its name to the Planned Parenthood
Federation of America in 1942) forced Florence Rose to leave in 1943 &amp;ndash;
a result of her inability to follow new bureaucratic procedures and her
allegiance to Sanger, who was immersed in her own clashes with Federation
staff. With Rose's departure, the Division of Negro Service floundered
and soon shut down. The Federation delegated &quot;Negro&quot; work to other
departments and eventually passed off remnants of the program to state
affiliates.</p>
<p> Arguments persist about whether or not the Negro Project was purely
a racist endeavor (search for &quot;Sanger&quot; &quot;Negro Project&quot; and &quot;racism&quot; on
the Internet and be prepared for the onslaught). Certainly the patriarchal
racism of the time that guided many of the social policies in Washington
and the practices of philanthropic and charitable organizations working
to &quot;lift up&quot; African-Americans, dictated both the Federation's and Sanger's
approach to blacks and birth control. The public rationale for the
Project was rooted in economics, tax-payer burden, and the social threats
posed by what was perceived to be an exploding black underclass, rather
than the health and sexual liberation of black women (though it should
be notes that the birth control movement largely ignored the issue of women's
â€”black or whiteâ€” sexual autonomy in the interwar years). And there
is no doubt that a good number of medical professionals involved in the
birth control movement exhibited strong racist sentiments, some of them
arguing for and even carrying out compulsory sterilization on black women
considered to be of low intelligence and therefore not capable of choosing
not to control their fertility, as well as on those deemed morally or behaviorally
deviant. But there is no evidence that Sanger or even the Federation
coerced or intended to coerce black women into using birth control.
The fundamental belief, underscored at every meeting, mentioned in much
of the behind-the-scenes correspondence, and evident in all the printed
material put out by the Division of Negro Service, was that uncontrolled
fertility presented the greatest burden to the poor, and Southern blacks
were among the poorest Americans. In fact, the Negro Project did
not differ very much from the earlier birth control campaigns in the rural
South designed to test simpler methods on poor, uneducated and mostly white
agricultural communities. Following these other efforts in the South,
it would have been more racist, in Sanger's mind, to ignore African-Americans
in the South than to fail at trying to raise the health and economic standards
of their communities.</p>
