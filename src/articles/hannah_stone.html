title: "Hannah Stone: The Madonna of the Clinic"

<p>When Margaret Sanger opened the Clinical Research Bureau of the American Birth Control League in 1923
she sought a woman physician to staff it, convinced that female patients would be more comfortable discussing sex
and birth control with another woman.   Finding any physician, let alone on who was a woman, was not easy, for
as Sanger explained "few doctors wanted to take the risk of identifying themselves with the birth control cause,
the risk of becoming a martyr, of losing professional license and standing, of being expelled from their medical
societies." ("Hannah M. Stone: In Memoriam," <em> Human Fertility</em>, August 1941, p. 109)  Yet Sanger
persevered, even after one doctor refused her offer and another had to be dismissed.  In 1925, Sanger hired Hannah Mayer
Stone, a talented and committed young doctor with impressive academic training who would serve Sanger for the
next sixteen years.</p>

<p>Hannah Mayer was born in New York in 1893, the daughter of a pharmacist.  She received her own degree in
pharmacology from Brooklyn College, and in 1912 was hired as a bacteriologist and serologist at Bellevue
Hospital.  Soon after she met Abraham Stone, a young Bellevue intern whom she married in 1917.  With the U.S.
at war, Abraham went off to serve in the military, while Hannah went to medical school.  She received her M.D.
in 1920 from New York Medical College and Flower Hospital, and joined the pediatrics staff at Woman's Lying-In Hospital in New York City.  When Abraham Stone returned home, he and Hannah also set up a private
practice.</p>

<p>  Hannah Stone first met Margaret Sanger in November of 1921 at
the first American Birth Control Conference.  Sanger was already
well-known for her intense, often confrontational commitment to
birth control.  Indeed at the final meeting of the conference held at
Town Hall, police arrested Sanger for speaking publicly about
birth control.  The conference helped Sanger organize the resources and support to set up a viable birth control
clinic to demonstrate the effectiveness, safety and usefulness of contraceptives when dispensed in an appropriate
setting.  Using the loophole provided by the 1918 NY State Court of Appeal's Brownsville Clinic decision, which
upheld the right of physicians to dispense contraception when medically indicated, Sanger knew she could legally
open a birth control clinic administered by a doctor.</p>

<p>In 1923, she hired Dr. Dorothy Bocker to provide the medical services for the newly opened Clinical Research
Bureau [CRB] (renamed the Birth Control Clinical Research Bureau [BCCRB] in 1928) at a salary of $5,000.
However, after the first year of operation, Dr. Bocker's salary was too high for the clinic's limited budget.  More
importantly, Sanger was disappointed with the quality of Bocker's work.  Not only was Bocker not experienced in
gynecological methods, but she  had failed to conduct follow-up work on the 20% of clinic patients who had not
returned for scheduled visits.  Instead Bocker had assumed that their treatment had been successful.  Bocker had
also used such a wide variety of contraceptive regimes that there was too little data on any one combination of
methods to be statistically relevant.  As one of Sanger's main purposes in establishing the clinic was to
demonstrate the effectiveness of specific contraceptives, Bocker's reports failed to provide the data she needed.
Looking for a replacement, Sanger turned to Hannah Stone, already a member of the BCCRB's medical advisory
committee.  Stone accepted the offer and, unlike Bocker, served the clinic without pay for the next sixteen years.</p>

<p>In Hannah Stone, Sanger found
not only a talented medical director,
but a calm, soft-spoken, intensely
loyal colleague:  "Her gaze was
clear and straight, her hair was
black, her mouth gentle and sweet."
Sanger later wrote, "She had a
sympathetic response to mothers in
distress, and a broad attitude
towards life's many
problems....These qualities have
kept her with us all this time, one of
the most beloved and loyal workers
that one could ever hope for." (<em>Autobiography</em>, 1938, pp. 360-361).  Indeed she came to be known
as "the Madonna of the clinic."
(Emily S. Mudd Interview,
Schlesinger Library Oral History
Project on Women in Family
Planning, May 21-August 3, 1974)
Not only was Stone a sensitive and
compassionate physician, but a
talented clinician as well, who
appreciated the need for compiling the detailed records necessary to prove the effectiveness and safety of birth
control.  By 1941 Stone had seen 100,000 patients at the clinic and created a detailed patient record for each one.
With the data she collected, Stone provided clinical evidence proving that use of the diaphragm, combined with
spermicidal jelly, was an effective contraceptive and caused no ill effects to the patient.  In 1928 she published
some of her findings in "Therapeutic Contraception," one of the first thorough reports on the subject to appear in
a medical journal (<em>Medical Journal and Record</em>, 1928), and in 1931 she published additional research in  The
Practice of Contraception, co-edited with Margaret Sanger.  Stone also participated in various studies of the
BCCRB's records by outside analysts, which led to several important studies by medical scientists on fertility and
gynecology.</p>

<p>    Hannah Stone's association with Sanger's clinic jeopardized any hopes she might have had of ascending the
medical ranks.  Her new work at the BCCRB conflicted with her position at the Women's Lying-In Hospital, and
when Stone refused to give up her clinic work, she was asked to resign from the hospital.  For Stone the choice
was not a difficult one, "`Of course I'll go along with you in this work," she told Sanger, "the other can get
thousands to do that work, but this needs some of us who know its importance and who care.'" (Sanger Diary,
July 14, 1941, <em>MSM</em> S70:554-5)  </p>

<p>      In 1929, Stone and four other BCCRB staff members were arrested during a police raid of the clinic.  While
the charges against Stone were dismissed and the raid generated long sought-after support from the city's medical
community, newspaper photos of Stone being led into a paddy wagon created a blemish on her record for many
years to come.  In 1932, the New York Medical Society tabled Stone's application for admission with no
explanation.  </p>

<p>     In the mid-1930's Sanger asked Stone to act as the guinea pig in a test case designed to challenge Federal laws
restricting the importation of contraceptive devices.  Stone ordered a box of 120 pessaries from Japan for possible
use in her private practice.  The U.S. Customs Office was then informed of the impending arrival of the package.
Customs seized the package and Hannah Stone brought suit on behalf of the clinic, arguing that as a licensed
physician she was permitted to receive the devices for legitimate medical applications.  The case, U.S. v. One
Package, went to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in New York, which ruled in 1936 that physicians could
legally import contraceptive devices for medical purposes. This landmark decision paved the way for de facto
legalization of birth control under the supervision of doctors.<p>     Stone was one of Margaret Sanger's few associates who did not covet the spotlight.  The internecine struggles
for power within the birth control movement seemed not to touch her.  "She was at times left out of this group &ndash;
pushed off this committee &ndash; ignored when she should be recognized," Sanger remembered.  "Her work,
discoveries, methods snapped up by others with more prominent names & used to their own advantage.  Doubtless
she must have been hurt, doubtless she must have felt the pangs of the knife thrust through the heart &ndash; but never
did I hear her beg or ask favors for herself or criticize others for these things.  Always she laughed at the reasons
given & the methods behind these acts." (Diary, July 14, 1941, <em>MSM</em> S70:57-8)

<p>     For Sanger, Hannah Stone's real legacy lay in
the quiet and efficient work she accomplished in
her role as the clinic's medical director.  As
Sanger noted, "It was she who...was most
responsible for the introduction of the knowledge
of contraceptive techniques to the medical
profession .... Thousands of medical students and
physicians came to the Bureau to observe her
techniques and receive instructions under her..."
("In Memoriam", August 1941)  And Sanger
frequently cited Stone's pioneering work in counseling couples with marital and/or sexual
problems. Stone's marriage advice sessions,
which began informally at first, led to the
organization of a Marriage Consultation Center
(run with her husband, Abraham) at the clinic
and at the Community Church.  In 1935 they
published their counseling techniques in A
Marriage Manual.</p>

<p>     Hannah Mayer Stone died unexpectedly of a
heart attack on July 10, 1941 at the age of 48.  Abraham Stone replaced his wife as the Medical Director of the
BCCRB, and faithfully filled the post for many years, but for Margaret Sanger, Hannah Stone's skill, empathy
and dedication were irreplaceable.  With her "Madonna-like beauty, coupled with her kindness and graciousness,"
Stone, according to Sanger, "inspired confidence in all who met her." ("In Memoriam", August 1941)  Most of
all, Hannah Stone's death left a void for the thousands of women who sought help at the clinic.  As Sanger
testified, it was Hannah Stone's "infinite patience, her attention to details, her understanding of human frailties,
her sympathy, her gentleness &ndash; to all these qualities of mind and personality...these thousands of mothers owed
their peace of mind, marital harmony, health and yes, in many cases, life itself." ("In Memoriam," August 1941).</p>
