title: "Margaret Sanger and the Modern School"
---

<p>Supporters and detractors alike have had a difficult time trying
to fit Margaret Sanger into a particular school of thought or
radical group during her formative years in the pre-World War
I Greenwich Village renaissance.  She later told friend and
biographer Harold Hersey (and he paraphrases here) that her
"feeling of strength" came from "certain leaders of the radical
movements, not from the radicals as a whole." (Margaret
Sanger: <em>The Biography of a Birth Control Pioneer,</em>
unpublished mss., 1938, p. 101) And indeed when reflecting
on the roots of her activism, Sanger usually referred to specific
personalities of that era &ndash; Emma
Goldman, Bill Haywood, Carlo Tresca, Eugene Debs, among
many others &ndash; rather than
Socialists, single tax proponents,
feminists, etc. Yet it is becoming
increasingly clear to us as we
select, transcribe and annotate
documents for the first volume
of <em>The Selected Papers of Margaret Sanger</em>
that she was more deeply
entrenched in leftist activities
and especially in the anarchist
movement than has generally
been thought.  This is most
clearly evident in her
relationship to the Modern
School, a small, experimental,
educational institution in New
York, founded and operated
largely by anarchists, which
provided Sanger with a greater
intellectual training ground and
network of radical support for
initiating the birth control
crusade than, arguably, any other
radical element or organization.</p>

<p>Like many aspects of Sanger's
early life, her association with the Modern School has received
only cursory analyses from birth control movement historians
and Sanger biographers.  Until historian Paul Avrich's The
Modern School Movement was published in 1980, little had
been written about the Modern Schools in America. And one
important link between Sanger and anarchism, arising from
Sanger's affiliation with the school, has only recently been
established through the Project's annotation research on
Sanger's early writings and correspondence (see "<a href="{% link articles/yeannis_revisited.html %}">Ye&acirc;nnis Revisited,</a>" ).</p>

<p>Francisco Ferrer established the first "Escuela Moderna" in
Barcelona in 1901 in an attempt to liberate education from the
controlling interests of the church and state. The school
succeeded and led to other branches before the government, in
1906, shut them down and implicated Ferrer in a plot to
assassinate the King of Spain. In 1909 the state pressed
trumped-up charges of insurrection against Ferrer following
violent street uprisings in response to Spain's colonial war in
Morocco. After a mock trial in October of 1909, Ferrer was
found guilty and executed by firing squad.</p>

<p>Ferrer's death spurred international
protests and widespread interest in
his work. Emma Goldman and
Alexander Berkman founded what
would become the first Modern
School in the U.S. in 1910 when
they started the Francisco Ferrer
Association in honor of the
martyred educator.  In 1911 the
Association established the Ferrer
Center and Modern School at St.
Mark's Place in New York, where
for ten months it conducted small
adult classes and Sunday lectures on
social issues before moving to a
larger space on East 12th Street.
There the center created a Day
School for children and enlarged its
other programs.</p>

<p>Margaret and William Sanger,
having moved from the suburbs
around 1911, were newly immersed
in the Greenwich Village bohemian
life and  saw in the Modern School
the type of progressive education
they wanted for their children.  It
emphasized free-thinking,
independence and self-development,
and it refrained from imposing
structure or discipline on the child, seeking instead to follow
the child's lead, his or her natural inclinations and interests.
The school also responded to issues related to sexuality,
evolution and other topics that the public schools feared and
fumbled with. The Sanger's  enrolled their eldest child, Stuart,
in the Day School in January of 1912. He joined eight other
pupils, mostly children of anarchists, in a class led by Will
Durant, later to become the famous interpreter of philosophy
for the masses. Both Grant and Peggy Sanger would also
attend Modern Schools prior to Peggy's death in 1915.</p>

<p>The Ferrer Center and Modern School quickly became an
important hub of radical life in New York.  Even when it
moved to its final New York location at East 107th Street in
October of 1912, it continued to attract a cross-section of
radical writers, artists, journalists, educators and activists. The
writer Jacques Rudome remembered:</p>

<blockquote>


    <p>Besides the day school . . . there were
     classes for adults in English, French,
     German, and Literature led by Leonard D.
     Abbott, and an art class conducted by Robert
     Henri and George Bellows.</p>

    <p>A galaxy of names famous through the
     nation were active in their cultural      contributions: Harry Kelly, Emma Goldman
     and Alexander Berkman; Hyppolyte Havel,
     who lectured on many subjects; Hutchins
     Hapgood who lectured on American and
     Russian literature; Sadakichi Hartman
     reading his morbid prose; Andre Tridon on
     Rodin before the Freud libido took
     possession of him; Lincoln
     Steffens on muckraking and the
     golden rule; George Brown, the
     gentle shoemaker from Arden, and
     Theodore Schroeder on free
     thought; Clarence Darrow on
     Voltaire . . . Bolton Hall and
     Harry Weinberger on single tax;
     Herbert Davisson and Edward
     King on socialism; the fiery Tom
     Mann on syndicalism; Bill
     Haywood on industrial unionism;
     Lucy Parsons on the Heymarket
     affair; Margaret Sanger and many
     others whose names now escape
     me. (Jacques Rudome quoted in Hersey, pp. 103-104)</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Others who delivered lectures or were
associated with the School and Center
included the writers Jack London, Manuel
Komroff, Eugene O'Neill, Lola Ridge,
Mike Gold and Upton Sinclair; and the
artists John Sloan, Max Weber, Man Ray,
Rockwell Kent, and Robert Minor. </p>

<p> The anarchist, Harry Kelly, one of the
school's founders, wrote "the place seethed
with animation and debate of vital issues,
and no cause was too poor nor too radical
or delicate to be denied a
hearing."  Opened daily,
the Center, writes Avrich,
". . . was a place where
radicals could come to
hear lectures on social or
literary topics, to discuss
the burning questions of
the day, to see new plays
. . . to listen to concerts .
. . to study art . . . It was
a place to learn the
English language, to
study French or Spanish
or Esperanto, to dance,
drink tea, and talk for
hours on end." (Paul
Avrich, <em>The Modern
School Movement,</em>
Princeton University
Press, 1980,  p. 111) </p>

<p>The Ferrer Center, Avrich writes,  was far more than an
educational institution, it became ". . . a center of propaganda
for anarchists, socialists, I.W.W.'s [International Workers of
the World] and syndicalists."  The school raised funds to
support anarchist causes around the world, organized protest
meetings and helped with strike support.  During the
Lawrence, Massachusetts strike in 1912, Sanger reached out to
families associated with the
School and found temporary
homes for children of striking
workers whom she had escorted
on the train to New York. (Avrich,
p. 90) For Sanger, who lacked an
intensive formal education, the
Ferrer Center provided an
unconventional liberal arts
education paired with a kind of
job-training center for leftist
activists.</p>

<p>At a time when Sanger met
resistance among the patriarchal
I.W.W. and Socialist Party to her
persistent appeals to include
women's sexual liberation in their
agenda, she found a welcome
audience at the Ferrer Center.  She
gave lectures on the limitation of
offspring and organized "mothers'
meetings" to discuss birth control
(Avrich, p. 132).  She also became
associated with a core group of
Ferrer School members who later
contributed their expertise to her
crusade.  Bill Shatoff, a printer
and Ferrer Center fixture, printed
Sanger's Family Limitation "after
hours when his shop was supposed to be closed." (MS,
<em>Autobiography</em>, 1938, p. 117). Journalist Leonard Abbott, one
of the founders of the School, raised money and helped
organize legal assistance for Margaret Sanger during her
Woman Rebel trial in 1914-1915, and for William Sanger after
he was arrested for giving a copy of Family Limitation to one
of Comstock's undercover agents in December of 1914.
Gilbert Roe, a Free Speech League lawyer and original
member of the Ferrer Association, also offered Margaret Sanger legal council on several occasions, most notably following  the Woman Rebel indictments. Many others helped, from artist Rockwell Kent who designed a birth control symbol for Sanger (it appears on the back of this newsletter), to Arthur Samuels, the treasurer at the Modern School, who
collected radical literature and birth control information while in Europe
for Sanger to use in designing the Woman Rebel. The Modern School is
also most likely where Sanger met a Greek anarchist and publisher named
John Rompapas, who may well have provided Sanger with seed money for
launching the Woman Rebel. Their torrid affair  accelerated Sanger's
separation from William Sanger, and brought her into even closer quarters
with New York's anarchist community.</p>

<p>Sanger became intimately associated
with the roots of the Spanish Modern
School movement when she fled to
Europe in the fall of 1914 in an
attempt to avoid imprisonment over
the Woman Rebel indictments. In Liverpool, where her ship
docked, she met Lorenzo Portet, who she described as  ". . .
once companion to Francisco Ferrer and now heir to his
educational work . . ." (<em>Autobiography</em>, p. 123).  Portet had
worked side-by-side with Ferrer from 1896 to Ferrer's death in
1909, organizing the Modern Schools and leading other
republican activities against the state.  Portet then taught
Spanish at the University of Liverpool and continued to work
for educational reform in Spain. Sanger and Portet forged a
close friendship that quickly  developed into a love affair.
They traveled the continent together, and Portet escorted
Sanger through Spain and taught her the history of the Modern
Schools.  After visiting Ferrer's grave, she wrote to her oldest
son that she "tho't of you & was proud that my Stuart had
attended the first Ferrer School in America." (MS to Stuart
Sanger, March 29, 1915, <em>MSM</em> S1:407).  Sanger wrote
in her journals and later in three published articles about her
travels in Spain, including the presence of "shadow-men,"
secret service agents who stayed a few steps back of  Portet
and any of his companions.  A hindrance to their privacy, the
"shadow-men" helped on one occasion to thwart a robbery of
Portet and Sanger by a group of young thieves. ("Portet and Ferrer, Part II"
<em>MSM</em> C16:105) In 1916 Portet offered to
find Sanger employment in Paris where he worked part of the
time, but he died the following year of tuberculosis, evidently
before Sanger had made a firm decision.</p>

<p>Sanger's association with the Modern School ended even
before the tragic death of Portet. In 1914, the Ferrer Center
Day School had moved to a new
site in Stelton, New Jersey (the
Ferrer Center remained in New
York until 1918).  In November of
1915 her daughter, Peggy, died of
pneumonia she contracted while
attending the Stelton School along
with her brother Grant.  Soon after
Peggy's death, Sanger moved
Grant to another school and
appears to have cut many of her
ties to the Ferrer group, possibly
blaming the school's rustic,
unheated buildings for Peggy's
illness. (Avrich, p. 238)</p>

<p>The Stelton School thrived for a
period in the 1920s and had many
ups and downs until it finally
closed in 1953.  The Ferrer Center
in New York received a terrible
blow, literally, when a bomb
exploded in a nearby apartment
building in July of 1914.  Three
anarchists who were regulars at
the Center were killed while
preparing the bomb that was
apparently meant to be set off on
John D. Rockefeller's estate in
Tarrytown, N.Y. The Center never
regained its status as a focal point for New York radicals and
was constantly hounded by police before it closed in 1918.
But the educational experiment was, on the whole, largely
successful.  The Modern School movement in America
produced close to twenty other schools across the county and
established a model for libertarian education that has
influenced many other progressive education efforts since.</p>

<p>There are few individuals or events in Sanger's life in the
years leading up to World War I that do not intersect with the
radical school and cultural center. And as we uncover more
information about Sanger's early radicalism, it is becoming
ever more apparent that her ties to anarchism, the driving force
behind the creation of the Modern School, are far more vital to
her understanding of radical history, protest movements, and
strategies for achieving radical reform than a majority of
scholars have suggested, or that Sanger herself ever
admitted. </p>
