title: "Margaret Sanger and 'a Glorious Chain of Clinics'"
---

<p>     In Mary McCarthy's <em> The Group</em>, the character of Dottie
Renfrew visits a New York City birth control clinic in 1934.
The ensuing experience is both liberating and embarrassing.
"Kay would hardly believe it but Dottie, all by herself, had
visited a birth control bureau and received a doctor's name and
sheaf of pamphlets that described a myriad of devices... and the
virtues and drawbacks of each." (p. 56)   The "Bureau" to
which McCarthy referred was the Margaret Sanger Research
Bureau which opened its doors in 1923.</p>

<p>     Clinics like the Bureau were a critical element in Margaret
Sanger's commitment to the birth control movement, for she
was convinced they were the most viable method of
disseminating contraceptive information.  Deeply impressed by
the network of birth control clinics each administered by
trained medical personnel that she observed during a 1914-5
visit to the Netherlands, Sanger wanted to replicate the Dutch
model in the United States: "Clinics &ndash;," she wrote "clinics in
which women can be given direct and individual instruction in
contraceptive methods, are the solution of the problem of
getting the Birth Control message to those who most need it."
Women, she insisted, "must be told by word of mouth and
shown by demonstration what to do and how to do it.
Otherwise much of our labor, so far as direct results go, is in
vain.  The answer is clinics." ("Clinics the Solution" July 1920, <em>MSM</em> S70:843).  </p>

<p>     Sanger "envisioned a glorious `chain' of clinics, thousands
of them, in every center of America.  I wanted to see
specialists doing research work and gathering data to bring the
subject up to other modern standards." (<em>My Fight for Birth Control</em>, 1931. p. 144)   Sanger's first clinic, opened in
Brownsville, Brooklyn in 1916, with Sanger and her sister
serving as the medical staff, closely followed the Dutch model
before it was shut down by police after less than two weeks in
operation.  Seven years later, Sanger opened the Birth Control
Clinical Research Bureau (BCCRB), the first legal doctor-staffed birth control clinic in the United States.  </p>

<p>     The BCCRB and the other clinics it inspired offered women
the same and often better contraceptive services as those
obtained through private physicians.  And not only did the
clinics focus specifically on reproductive issues, they were
reasonably priced to those who could afford them and free to
those who could not.  At a time when most women learned
about reproduction and contraception through gossip and word
of mouth, birth control clinics provided more than just
gynecological examinations with contraceptive fittings; they
served as a vehicle for educating women about their physiology
and offered a forum for women to discuss their sexual and
gynecological problems with other knowledgeable women.  A
few clinics even offered infertility counselling, and there is
some evidence to suggest that clinic staff sometimes referred
women to sympathetic doctors or hospitals for therapeutic
abortions, although clinics could not perform legal abortions
until the 1960s. </p>

<p>     At the Clinical Research Bureau and similar birth control
clinics, new patients were screened for eligibility; some clinics
required that women be married (or in some cases engaged)
and not pregnant at the time of the visit.  Next, they were asked
a number of background questions, varying from clinic to clinic
in depth, but including factors such as age, age at marriage,
medical history, (including number of pregnancies, abortions,
or miscarriages), number of living children, and income level.
Some clinics requested information concerning sexual practices
and hereditary problems.  The patient then met with a doctor,
who evaluated the case history and, if appropriate, prescribed a
contraceptive.  If a diaphragm was recommended, patients
were measured and given proper instruction in its use by a
doctor or nurse.  A follow-up visit was usually scheduled for
the ensuing week and at regular intervals thereafter, both to
check the measurements and to replenish expendable
contraceptive supplies such as jellies.</p>

<p>     With a large  stake in the success of contraception, the
clinic, unlike most physicians in private practice, conducted
much more detailed follow-up work with their patients.  Clinic
staff measured the success rate, of course, but also paid close
attention to the women who did not return to the clinic or who
discontinued contraceptive use.  Sanger's clinic had several
social workers on staff who checked on women who missed
refitting appointments, and kept careful records on success
rates and specific reasons for complaint or failure.</p>

<p>     The BCCRB served as the medical arm of the American
Birth Control League (ABCL), founded in 1921, which focused
on educational and legislative change.  By 1926 the ABCL was
flooded with hundreds of thousands of requests for help from
women and couples, and responded by providing
correspondents with the name and address of the nearest
sympathetic doctor or clinic.  </p>

<p>     After establishing the BCCRB, the largest of the U.S.
clinics, Sanger worked to help found other clinics which sprang
up in cities across the nation; including Chicago (1924),  Los
Angeles (1925), San Antonio (1926), Detroit and Baltimore
(1927), Cleveland, Newark, and Denver (1928), and Atlanta,
Cincinnati, and Oakland (1929).  Wherever she traveled across
the US in the 1920s and 1930s, Sanger prodded her audiences
to open clinics.  Even if clinics were not immediately opened,
many birth control leagues were formed in the wake of her
visits.  Most of these leagues were organized by middle class or
well-to-do women, sometimes in cooperation with social
workers, ministers, and physicians.  They focused on lobbying
for birth control legislation or promoting public education on
reproductive issues.  Those leagues willing to take the risks and
responsibilities of hiring a physician opened dispensing clinics
to offer medical services in addition to counseling and
referrals.</p>

<p>     Sanger's American Birth Control League and the BCCRB
provided instructions for every aspect of setting up a clinic,
including suggestions for a name, recommendations for
facilities, staffing, and equipment, advice on financial and legal
matters,  and a list of "medical indications" for which
contraception could be legally prescribed.  Those clinics which
met Sanger's standards were officially affiliated with the BCCRB, an imprimatur of quality.  By 1930, some of the
services that birth control clinics provided included: infertility
and sterility treatments, sterilization, sex education, and
marriage counseling (Robinson, <em> Seventy Birth Control Clinics</em>,
1930, pp. 158-162)  </p>

<p>     For
most
local
clinics,
funding
was an
ongoing
problem.
Most
depended on
private
support
to stay
in
business, as
public
funds were unavailable.  Some of the more prominent clinics,
such as Sanger's BCCRB and the Los Angeles Mother's Clinic
were fortunate. "Los Angeles... raised all its funds specially
and privately, its doctors donating their time, but now it has
received two bequests: $30,000 from Dr. [Henry] Brainerd,
and $150,000 from Clara Baldwin Stocker."  (Robinson, p.
112)  However, most struggled to break even on their services.
In Illinois, the local league and clinic brought in only "$6,644
in contributions and dues in 1926, and $4,165.73 from the sale
of supplies and fees from patients able to pay." (Robinson, p.
112)  As a result, many local clinics depended on voluntary
contributions of time and/or money to survive, factors which
limited their multiplication and expansion.  </p>

<p>     Aside from financial difficulties, the clinic movement also
faced religious and political opposition.  The Chicago clinic
was, for example, refused a license "on the grounds that the
purpose of the clinic was `against public policy, tends to
corrupt morals, and is unlawful.'" ("Report of the Illinois Birth
Control League" in <em> International Aspects of Birth Control</em>,
1925, p. 155)  Represented by Harold Ickes, later a member of
Franklin D. Roosevelt's administration, the Illinois Birth
Control League fought the decision.  While the Illinois League
was denied the right to open a free clinic, it was able to
proceed with the Chicago clinic if it charged small fees.  The
Chicago clinic was fortunate.  In Massachusetts, for example,
laws prohibited the opening of any sort of clinic, and Catholic
pressure was responsible for the cancellation of clinic plans
around the country.</p>

<p>     Nevertheless, from the late 1920s until the end of the
1930s, the number of birth control clinics continued to grow to
approximately 320 by 1937.  However for Sanger this was not
enough.  "I look forward to seeing, not twice that number, but
ten times that number at the close of this year..." she wrote
"We must also reach and help thousands of women who are
unfamiliar with or isolated from clinics, by sending nurses into
their homes to teach them. ("A New Day Dawns for Birth
Control," July 1937, MSM S64:748)  Furthermore, Sanger
envisioned the incorporation of birth control education and
services into public health programs throughout the country, in
effect, reducing the reliance on the small, doctor-staffed clinics
she created and allowing for a broader range of health workers
and facilities to dispense contraception.  However, opposition
to birth control remained intense and government funding
scarce.  </p>

<p>     Today there are close to a thousand clinics affiliated with
the Planned Parenthood Federation of America across the
nation and additional thousands of unaffiliated and commercial
clinics. (<em>Insider</em>, January, 1994, p. 2).  Like those of the earlier
generation, these modern clinics provide a wide variety of
medical, counseling, and referral services.  While the
emphasis may have shifted to counseling on problems relating
to AIDS prevention and teenage pregnancy, for the most part
the mission of today's clinics remains the same:  to provide
women with a full complement of preventative health care
services.    </p>

<p>     Sanger wanted birth control to be "understood by the public
at large.  It must be removed from the realm of propaganda and
argument, and accepted as a way of life." ("A New Day Dawns
for Birth Control, July 1937, <em>MSM</em> S64:748)  Today's birth
control is in many respects, part of our way of life.  Though
their use is still debated and sometimes questioned,
contraceptives are available in many supermarkets, most drug
stores and even many schools. Indeed our own government,
instead of prohibiting the distribution of birth control to
women, may soon make it mandatory for welfare mothers.  Yet
birth control has not become a part of the public health system
to the degree Sanger hoped.  Most birth control clinics continue
to be privately operated, but are reliant on government funding
for large portions of their budgets.  Unfortunately the nature
and level of government support has shifted with changing
political agendas.  In post-election 1994, it is likely that
women's clinics will have to renew their fight to continue to
offer women affordable, reliable, effective services for all their
health care needs.</p>
