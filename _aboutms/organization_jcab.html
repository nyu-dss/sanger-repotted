<h1>Joint Committee of the ABCL and BCCRB</h1>
<h2>History</h2>

<p>In June of 1938, the <a href="organization_abcl.html">American Birth Control League</a> (ABCL) and <a href="organization_bccrb.html">Birth Control Clinical Research Bureau</a> (BCCRB) formed a Joint Committee to consider closer coordination of all research, teaching, field organization, clinical work, and educational activities of the League and the Bureau. This effort was aimed at countering financial problems faced by both the League and the BCCRB as donors split their contributions between the two organizations, and as competition over clinic affiliations and disagreements about lobbying activities between the two groups intensified. The Committee's goal was to develop a program that would provide for greater efficiency in service and administration of clinics and state organizations, and to consider the feasibility of a merger.</p>

<p>Several meetings between representatives of the two organizations as well as the <a href="organization_cmh.html">National Committee on Maternal Health</a>, and the management firm, John Price Jones, Inc., led to fact-finding studies and a "Summarized Factual Report with Analysis and Conclusions" submitted by D. Kenneth Rose of John Price Jones, Inc. and George Aubrey Hastings. The report found that considerable duplication of work of the two organizations existed in every branch of their activities. Based on this report, the Committee's final recommendation was for a complete merger. On January 19, 1939 the two organizations officially merged into the <a href="organization_bcfa.html">Birth Control Federation of America</a>. The Committee approved a slate of new officers, with Richard N. Pierson as chairman and president pro tem. Margaret Sanger was consigned to the limited role of honorary chairman of the board of directors.</p>
