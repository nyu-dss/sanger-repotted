				<h1>About the Project</h1>
				
				<p>The Margaret Sanger Papers Project is a historical editing project sponsored first by the <a href="https://www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/history" target="_new">Department of History</a> and 
				then by the <a href="http://library.nyu.edu/about">Division of Libraries</a> at <a href="https://www.nyu.edu/" target="_new">New York University</a>. The Project was 
				formed by Dr. Esther Katz in 1985 to locate, arrange, edit, research, and publish the papers of the noted birth control pioneer.</p>

				<p>The Margaret Sanger Papers Project has published a two-series microfilm edition, the <a href=../../publications/microfilm-4.html><i>Margaret 
				Sanger Papers Microfilm Edition</i></a> Smith College Collections and the Collected Documents Series. Work on the Smith College Collections entailed the rearrangement 
				and organization of over 50,000 Sanger documents in the Margaret Sanger collection and seventeen other collections at the Sophia Smith Collection and Smith College Archives. 
				Work on the Collected Documents Series included a ten-year international search of over 1,500 archives and private collections, photocopying material and organizing over 9,000 
				documents for publication. Both series have been published with a printed reel guide that includes an item-level index by University Publications of 
				America (now <a href="https://cisupa.proquest.com/ws_display.asp?filter=upa_intermediate&amp;item_id={8A05BFDC-6146-42E4-BC54-1D887B081E00}">Proquest)</a>. Proquest has 
				recently digitized the microilm and made it available as part of its <a href="https://proquest.libguides.com/historyvault/sanger">History Vault</a>.</p>

				<p>Next, the Project produced a digital edition of <a href="http://sangerpapers.org/documents/aboutedition.php">The Public Speeches and Writings (1911-1959)</a>. Additions and revisions to this are ongoing</p>
				<p>The Project also completed a four-volume book edition of Sanger's Papers,  published by the <a href="https://www.press.uillinois.edu/" target="_new">University of Illinois Press</a>.  The volumes are subtitled <span class="italicText"><a href="https://www.nyu.edu/Admin/Dropbox/MSPP-NYU/publications/volume_i.html">The Woman Rebel, 1900-1928</a></span>,<i><a href="https://www.nyu.edu/Admin/Dropbox/MSPP-NYU/publications/volume_ii.html"> Birth Control Comes of Age, 1928-1939</a></i>, <i><a href="https://www.nyu.edu/Admin/Dropbox/MSPP-NYU/publications/volume_iii.html">The Politics of Planned Parenthood, 1939-1966</a></i>, and <i><a href="../../publications/volume_iv-2.html">'Round the World for Birth Control, 1920-1966)</a></i> .</p>

				<p>In addition, the Project published an electronic edition of a small sample of documents related to Sanger's <i><a href="https://www.nyu.edu/Admin/Dropbox/MSPP-NYU/publications/electronic_ed/ms_and_the_woman_rebel.html">Woman Rebel</a></i> and is working on a larger electronic edition of Sanger's <a href="https://www.nyu.edu/Admin/Dropbox/MSPP-NYU/publications/electronic_ed/speeches_andarticles.html">speeches and articles</a>.</p>
