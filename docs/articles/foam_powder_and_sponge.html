<h1>"Foam Powder and Sponge: The Quest for Doctorless Birth Control"</h1>

<p>     The late 1930s brought a series
of major triumphs for
Margaret Sanger and
the American birth
control movement.  In
1936, a U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals
decision in the <em>US vs.
One Package</em> case, a
test case instigated
by Sanger in 1932
involving the illegal
importation of
diaphragms,
essentially removed
federal legal bans on
contraception. The
American Medical
Association finally
endorsed birth control
at their annual
meeting in 1937, the
official medical
sanction that Sanger
had long sought.  And
a 1938 poll published
in the Ladies Home Journal showed
that 79% of American women believed
in birth control, a statistic that Sanger
hoped would finally convince state and
federal governments to incorporate
contraceptive services into public
health programs.  Surveying the status
of birth control that year, Sanger wrote
"Birth Control...is at last freed" ("The
Status of Birth Control: 1938," <em> New Republic</em>, <em>MSM</em> S71:1020).</p>

<p>     Yet Sanger's triumphs were
muted by the failure of the birth control
movement to
reach a
substantial
number of poor
and working
class women,
the very women
that Sanger set
out to reach
when she
instigated her
crusade in 1914. 
As Sanger
explained to
Rockefeller
Foundation
representative
Arthur Packard
in 1937:</p>

<p>Our clinics
today
while
doing
great good
in the
areas in
which
they are
located,
are failing
to reach
the
masses of
women
throughout
the world that
it has been
my desire
from the very
start of the
work to aid
and assist. 
By the
masses of
women, I
refer to those
countless
thousands
who cannot
afford the
cheapest of
present day
contraceptives and who,
even if they
could, cannot
reach a
doctor or
clinic for the
necessary
fitting  (MS to
Arthur
Packard, July
4, 1937, <em>MSM</em>
C6:552).
</p>

<p>     Sanger molded the American
birth control movement around the idea
of offering safe and effective
contraception through medical
professionals operating in clean and
controlled environments; admitting the
shortcomings of this strategy amounted
to agreeing with many of her critics
among feminists and human service
providers that the clinic movement had
largely abandoned the needs of the
poor.  While Sanger was among the
most active proponents of "doctorless" birth control during the
early years of her crusade &ndash; publishing
directions for using inexpensive
methods such as douches and
suppositories in her 1914 manual
Family Limitation &ndash; her support of
doctor-controlled delivery of
contraceptives led her to focus more
attention on promoting the use of the
diaphragm.  However, she never wholly
abandoned her interest in cheaper more
accessible methods. And by the mid-1930s, with opposition to birth control
more contained than ever before,
Sanger allocated 
increased time and resources to
developing and testing new
contraceptives.</P>

<p>     Sanger
had
favored the
spring-form
diaphragm
ever
since
visiting clinics in Holland in 1915,
where a prototype "Mensinga"
diaphragm was successfully used by
hundreds of women.  The diaphragm
and jelly contraceptive was the chief
means of fertility control prescribed by
Sanger's Birth Control Clinical Research
Bureau and clinics across the country. 
But while the diaphragm was very
effective when properly used,  many
women found it complicated and
unpleasant.   And for poor women it
was especially burdensome since it
required a doctor's visit for proper
measuring and fitting,  follow-up
fittings, some degree of privacy to
insert, as well as clean, hygienic
conditions such as running water &ndash;
something not found in many poorer
American homes during the Depression. </p>


<p>     Sanger sought an alternative and
during the 1920s and 1930s, pursued
scientific research on two new
permanent forms of birth control:
spermotoxins (substances that would
immunize women against sperm), and
hormonal research aimed at inhibiting
ovulation.  Both were highly
experimental and unproven, and
seemed unlikely to lead to practical
forms of fertility control in Sanger's
lifetime.  She also investigated
promising anecdotal evidence on
several other contraceptive home
remedies, including the "Fiji herb," a
substance made from the bark of the
Kakaula tree that reportedly caused
sterility in both males and females; and
salt-based spermicides that physician
and Procter and Gamble heir, Clarence
Gamble repeatedly tested in Asia.  But
local remedies of this nature failed to
hold up under scientific investigation.
Sanger held out hopes for a "pill" or
shot that would preclude barrier
methods and spermicidal solutions, but
in the interim pursued and promoted
alternate versions of barrier methods
that would eliminate both the need for
physicians and the discomfort
associated with the diaphragm.</p>

<p>     The most promising method-for-the-masses tested and promoted by
Sanger during this period was the foam
powder or jelly and sponge
contraceptive.  Although the sponge
had been used as a contraceptive in
many cultures throughout history, it
was largely abandoned in the late 19th
and early 20th centuries in favor of
rubber diaphragms.  But promising
clinic tests conducted in Miami by a
controversial physician and birth control
researcher, Lydia Allen DeVilbiss, on a
natural or rubber sponge and a new
spermicidal powder won the attention
of Sanger and her Birth Control Clinical
Research Bureau, as well as the
American Birth Control League (ABCL)
and the National Committee on
Maternal Health.  </p>

<p>      DeVilbiss (1882-1964), an
ardent eugenicist, expert on child
hygiene, and director of the Mothers
Health Clinic in Miami Florida, had held
prominent public health positions in
several states.  Her concern with
maternal mortality among the poor,
along with her class and race-based
conviction that many poor families &ndash;
blacks in particular &ndash; were unable to
effectively use sophisticated
contraceptive devices such as
diaphragms, led to her zealous
exploration of simpler and cheaper
means of fertility control.  Working
with chemists, veterinarians and
pathologists, she created a recipe for a
contraceptive powder with a base of
sulphonated alcohol.  The powder was
used with a small sponge attached to a
string.  Unlike a diaphragm, the sponge
did not need to cover the cervix; it
simply served as a reservoir for the
spermicidal powder (essentially a soap)
which turned to foam upon insertion in
the vagina.   In theory, and to some
degree in practice, the foam powder
and sponge method did not require
visits to a clinic but rather a single
short home visit from a nurse and some
brief words of instruction.  Few
sanitary conveniences were necessary
to use the sponge, and it was said it
could even be left in for several days
without causing irritation.  Best of all it
cost pennies when mass produced.  </p>

<p>DeVilbiss' preliminary report in
1935 on limited trial use of the foam
powder and sponge seemed to show
positive results: "...a gratifying
percentage of success can be attained
by careful instruction in the homes
even among patients of limited
intelligence," she declared, "and at a
fraction of the cost of ordinary clinic
methods" (DeVilbiss to MS, Nov.
20, 1935, <em>MSM</em> S10:659).
However, her statistics raised concern
among other researchers since 77 out
of 271 subjects never reported back. 
Nevertheless, DeVilbiss claimed that
only 9 women became pregnant out of
194 who had used foam power for a
year; and 7 of the pregnant women
admitted to non- or improper use (DeVilbiss to MS, Nov. 20, 1935,
<em>MSM</em> S10:661).</p>

<p>     When, in the fall of 1935, just
prior to her departure for a tour of Asia, 
Sanger was apprised of DeVilbiss'
success
with
foam
powder
she
expressed interest
and
offered
to "take
the
powder
to India,
or
better
still
perhaps
have
the
formula,
if it
could
be so
simplified that it could be prepared in
India or the Orient ..." (MS to DeVilbiss, Sept. 19, 1935, <em>MSM</em> S10:372).  Yet Sanger refused to
wholeheartedly endorse DeVilbiss'
work or promote her formula more
energetically than other soaps and
jellies undergoing tests in both the U.S.
and England, even though DeVilbiss'
foam powder showed the most promise
in terms of effectiveness, ease of use,
and expense.  </p>

<p>     A great distrust of DeVilbiss had
fermented in Sanger ever since
DeVilbiss accepted Sanger's invitation
to head up her New York clinic in
1923, then bowed out at the last
minute to protect her career.  Ever
mindful of her own reputation, Sanger
was also infuriated by DeVilbiss' claim
of pioneer status in the movement, and
her frequent behind-the-back criticisms
of Sanger, including the suggestion that
Sanger was out of touch with the plight
of poor women and tamed to passivity
by political and fund-raising
considerations.  After DeVilbiss
responded that she was glad that
Sanger had finally seen the light on the
need for more democratic birth control,
Sanger replied in a courteous but
defensive manner, typical of her letters
to DeVilbiss:</p>

<p>
I am rather amused at your
statement that you are glad to
know that I am coming to the
same conclusion that you came
to a number of years ago
regarding the importance of a
cheap contraceptive.  I did not
have to travel to Japan nor to
China in 1922 to realize this for
back in 1914 and during the
years preceding that time during
my work with the women of our
slum districts, I saw that even
the little cheap French pessary,
which at that time sold for 50›,
was too expensive and too
complicated to be of general use
to the masses (MS to DeVilbiss, Sept. 19, 1935, <em>MSM</em>
S10:370).</p>

<p>     Sanger, became more suspicious
of DeVilbiss' motives on receiving
reports from an aide who was in
regular contact with DeVilbiss,
informing Sanger of "Dr.  Dee's" (as
she was known) penchant for
performing sterilizations on poor
women.  She "sterilizes women," wrote
Hazel Zborowski,
through the medium of
introducing something into the
uterus which sets up an
inflammation with the result that
a scar tissue is formed
obstructing the passage.  She
claims this is a very simple
operation requiring only a few
moments in the office .  .  ."
(Hazel Zborowski to MS, Aug.
6, 1935, <em>MSM</em> S10:271).</p>


<p>     If Sanger did not express overt
disapproval of the large number of
sterilizations DeVilbiss performed, her
controversial techniques, or the racist
management of her Miami clinic where
services were segregated and based
upon an assumption that black women
were not intelligent enough to properly
use a diaphragm, she also did not
condone them.  Sanger frequently
ignored the racial motivations of
eugenicists such as DeVilbiss, if she
thought their support and research
would benefit her movement.  She
maintained  a working relationship with
DeVilbiss and contributed money to
support the foam powder trials even
after the ABCL had rejected DeVilbiss'
research methods earlier in 1935.  At
the same time Sanger told others that
DeVilbiss was undependable,
quarrelsome, impatient with standard
scientific trials, and incapable of
keeping adequate records.  But the
potential of the foam powder and
sponge outweighed, in Sanger's mind,
any liabilities that DeVilbiss' politics or
clinical techniques posed.</p>

<p>     Foam powder trials were
conducted in 1936 and 1937 by
DeVilbiss in Miami and at the Birth
Control Clinical Research Bureau in
New York under Sanger's watchful eye. 
Although the case studies were small,
the results suggested that the method,
if used properly, was nearly as reliable
as the diaphragm and jelly combination. 
Both studies, however, showed a
relatively high refusal rate.  In the
Bureau study, for instance, more than a
third of the women never used the
method after it was prescribed to them,
or discontinued its use after a short
period, complaining of irritation,
messiness, husband's objections due to
"physical awareness," and a lack of
confidence (<em>The Journal of
Contraception</em>, 3:1, [Jan. 1938], 3-6).</p>

<p>     Another field test in the South
ran into different problems.  In 1937, 
North Carolina, the first state to
incorporate birth control into a public
health program, started county
contraceptive programs for the indigent
(segregated).  Clarence Gamble
donated money to the North Carolina
effort largely to
test foam powder
on a
large group of
poor women.  
But only a very
small percentage
of eligible women
(under 10%)
actually benefitted
from the program. 
Local public health
officials were
slow to recruit
patients, and local
doctors who could
have helped sell
the program
avoided affiliation since the foam
powder
method
precluded their
services, and,
according to
historian
James
Reed,
partly
because
they
thought
any
effort to
help the
poor
and
uneducated,
especially
blacks, was futile (James Reed, <em>The
Birth Control Movement and American
Society: From Public Vice to Private
Virtue</em>, pp.  252-256).  Consequently,
the North Carolina study was
inconclusive as to the effectiveness of
foam powder.</p>

<p>     After the completion of
additional studies on foam powder in
Florida, Tennessee and Virginia,  both
Gamble and Sanger remained optimistic
that the foam powder and sponge
would eventually succeed with poor
women living in rural areas more
effectively than other methods.   "The
Foam Powder Method seems an answer
to a prayer...,'' Sanger wrote in a
fundraising letter during the summer of
1937 (MS to Arthur Packard, July 4,
1937, <em>MSM</em> C6:552). However,
constant tinkering with the various
contraceptive formulas used in the field
tests, and the introduction of a lactic
acid jelly spermicide in some of the
trials produced inconclusive results. 
More troubling was DeVilbiss' feud
with chemist Philip Stoughton, the New
York researcher responsible for
producing the primary foam powder
product with the widest circulation. 
DeVilbiss and Stoughton both claimed
rights to the original formula and
accused each other of pursuing
commercial gain. Early in 1937, on the
advice of attorney, DeVilbiss refused to
supply any more formula to Sanger's
Birth Control Clinical Research Bureau
or any other testing facility, or to share
recipes for old or new foam powders
and jellies because Stoughton "might
take the notion to claim these as his
property also" (DeVilbiss to MS, Apr.
29, 1937, <em>LCM</em>, 6:461).  </p>

<p>     Sanger refused to get drawn into
such skirmishes, telling another
chemist; "...having started this series
of tests and interest in research, I
refuse to stop because of personal
animosities toward the manufacturer or
chemist" (MS to Carl Scheffel, January
21, 1937, <em>MSM</em> S12:456).  But as
more difficulties with the method
surfaced, including instances of
disintegrating sponges, clumping
problems in the foam powder cans due
to humidity, certain ingredients losing
potency over time, and continued
incidences of irritation, Sanger, Gamble
and others lost some of their
enthusiasm.  Moreover, Sanger's long
experience with prescribing diaphragms
had convinced her that some
percentage of women would simply
avoid all barrier methods.  In 1935,
even before significant trials had been
completed on the foam powder and
sponge, she wrote to DeVilbiss:
"...while it would seem that the
insertion of a sponge or the insertion of
a suppository or jelly is simple enough,
they all involve a certain amount of
trouble and will keep a certain number
of women from using them" (MS to DeVilbiss, Sept. 19, 1935, <em>MSM</em> S10:370).</p>

<p>     In addition, in 1938 Sanger sent
out supplies of foam powder and
sponges to small clinics and doctors
throughout the country and most
reported mixed results.  Several
responses indicated that a number of
patients did not fully understand how
to use the method or had overriding
health complications, such as
gonorrhea, that interfered with proper
use.  One clinic administrator in
Washington, D.C.  sent Sanger a report
based on a fairly small number of
users, listing numerous failures and
complaints, such as "soreness, gas,
dizziness and burning" associated with
prolonged use of the foam powder
(Agnes McNutt to MS, June 24, 1938,
<em>MSM</em> S15:349).</p>

<p>     By the early 1940s, Sanger had
turned her attention to trying to
establish educational programs aimed
at training African-American field
workers to organize clinics in
segregated regions of the South.  The
foam powder and sponge method
continued to be studied but not with
the urgency or grand expectations of
the earlier trials.  "Doctorless" birth
control lost some of its attraction once
field workers noted the need for
gynecological care in many poorer
communities.  Getting women into a
clinic for contraceptive services helped
control other health problems. 
Eventually Clarence Gamble and many
state health officials in the South joined
Sanger in abandoning DeVilbiss and her
dubious clinical trials, all of them citing
their inability to work with her.  </p>

<p>     In the 1950s as her work
focused on international programs,
Sanger again encouraged use and
examination of foam powder and jellies
abroad, particularly in India where it
met with considerable success. (MS to DeVilbiss, Mar. 20, 1952, <em>MSM</em>
S36:956). While a few major
manufacturers were producing
spermicidal foams, including DuPont
and Johnson & Johnson, the cost was
substantially higher than the foam
powder products developed by
DeVilbiss and Stoughton. Sanger
restarted her correspondence with
DeVilbiss after more than 15 years in
order to obtain DeVilbiss' foam powder
formula to send to India. "...it seems to
me," Sanger wrote in 1952, "that the
greatest contribution that anyone could
make to the peace of the world today
is to offer a formula to the head of a
nation as a means to peace" (MS to DeVilbiss, Apr. 15, 1952, <em>MSM</em>
S37:119). DeVilbiss, flattered that
Sanger had approached her again,
complied with Sanger's wishes and
sent her the formula and copyright.</p>

<p>     Reports from field
representatives working under the
auspices of the International Planned
Parenthood Federation throughout the
1950s show evidence of successful
use of the foam powder and sponge in
Asia, Africa, the Caribbean and Mexico. 
In Canada, birth control organizer
Alfred Tyrer developed his own
"rubber-tissue sponge" that proved
popular in Canadian clinics. The sponge
paired with a jelly or foam found a
niche in the product offerings of birth
control clinics around the world, but
the method never became the ultimate
means of fertility control for the poor
that Sanger had envisioned. By the
1950s Sanger was concentrating on
supporting research to ready the
anovulant pill for market, the next great
"answer to a prayer" in her quest for
more democratic birth control.</p>

<p>     It is clear from the statistical and
anecdotal evidence collected on the
foam powder trials that it was
counterproductive (not to mention
immoral and unethical) to promote and
circulate a single birth control method
based solely on race and class.
Condoms were generally inexpensive
yet seldom offered in conjunction with
other barrier methods.  And field tests
in 1936 on a jelly spermicide used
without diaphragm and sponge, along
with the foam powder trials in 1936-1938, reported frequent requests for
other contraceptives besides the one
being tested (James Reed, <em>The Birth
Control Movement and American
Society</em>, p. 251). While the failure rate
for women using the foam powder and
sponge was relatively low, all of the
clinical trials exhibited a high number of
non-use cases, suggesting that many
women were simply put off by this
particular method.  Research conducted
by Sanger at her Negro Clinic in Harlem
in the early 1930s, and other clinic
studies carried out by researchers
within and apart from the birth control
movement, concluded that poor and
minority women could and would
successfully use a variety of
contraceptives as often as middle class
white women.  </p>

<p>     The medical profession recently
announced that a large dosage of
certain birth control pills taken (under a
doctor's direction) up to 72 hours after
intercourse usually prevents pregnancy. 
This long-delayed disclosure represents
another instance of the medical
community's reluctance to offer all
women, and especially poor women,  a
wide array of choices for fear of
misuse. The fact that many women
with access to the range of
contraceptive choices available have
utilized "morning after" pills for years
makes the long period of official silence
all the more unpalatable. We can gain
from Sanger's mistakes today by
recognizing that the imposition of
limitations on all women's birth control
choices tends to confound the
democratizing effect of any one
method.  The push to offer RU486 and
the "morning after pill," though far
from "doctorless," demonstrates that
those who carry on Sanger's legacy are
learning  they must increase choice at
all costs in order to reach the largest
number of women and men.</p>
