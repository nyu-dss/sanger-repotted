        <h1>TO MOTHERS ---- OUR DUTY</h1>
        <h3>By Margaret H. Sanger</h3>
        <p>In this day and age, when women are striving to their utmost to compete with their
            sisters in matters of dress, fashion, in "bridge," or anything which offers amusement or
            diversion from the old routine of our mothers' day, we hear a great deal from the male
            element about "Woman's Duty."</p>
        <p>This question of duty seems to be a stickler, and seems to confine itself to woman
            only.</p>
        <p>This "duty," so called, means that women should remain at home, not necessarily to drudge
            -- not at all -- for among those women referred to above, the servant question forms a
            large part of their conversation; but all "duty" means the care of the home, of the
            children -- the problem of feeding them carefully (even scientifically), of making their
            little bodies strong and robust, in fact, of giving them a good foundation mentally and
            physically -- for life.</p>
        <p>Most men think a woman's duty is done when she attends to these needs of her children,
            but to me she has but begun to do her duty.</p>
        <p>Let us take a young woman in the most ideal conditions of this life; she has given much
            thought and consideration to the life of her boy long before he was born, her every
            thought for almost a year was this child. He now comes into the world a rosy, healthy
            being, and she feels proud her work is so well begun; and she may well be proud.</p>
        <p>Then follow the years of care. Every conceivable attention, mental and moral, she gives
            him; his childhood, his boyhood, is one joyous song of the pleasures of living, and
            after years of these joys he emerges into manhood. He is now ready for the great battle
            of life.</p>
        <p>This mother has done her duty, and she sends him forth, clean, honest, moral, to get his
            living, but has she ever given the manner in which he is to obtain that living a
            thought?</p>
        <p>That is considered outside woman's "duty."</p>
        <p>We women can build them up, these bodies and minds, build them up to our highest
            expectations and then push them out upon a world whose system is greed, exploitation,
            graft and scientific robbery.</p>
        <p>Can we expect these morals to stay built up in these corrupt surroundings?</p>
        <p>As this case is an ideal one, so it is an exceptional one; let us turn, then, to one
            which is no exception.</p>
        <p>This is the case of the most abused, most dejected, most imposed upon class of mothers
            which our social system presents to us, and their number is legion.</p>
        <p>Here we find the little mothers at 8, 9 and 10 years of age; here we see them already at
            work carrying responsibilities of the home, factory or mill; education is a thing apart
            from this child, childhood yearnings are crushed, childish joys are barred here, there
            is time for but one thing -- work. Work through childhood, through girlhood and
            womanhood.</p>
        <p>We follow this child-mother up to the marriage day and find she has given her childhood,
            girlhood, womanhood, her strength, her very life to the factory or mill for an
            existence, an existence which the owner of the factory would not allow his horse or dog.
            Her face is pale and pinched with that hunting look of poverty; it never changes -- she
            is born, lives and dies with that look. She is married at night after the day's work,
            that she lose not one day's time.</p>
        <p>On, on in the same monotonous way; on, on, waiting for the end.</p>
        <p>There's no time for her to think of the little one's coming; she must work only the
            harder because of its coming.</p>
        <p>After months of worry, toil, privation and physical exhaustion this child, too, is born.
            Let us see what this woman gives to society. Her child is undersized, underfed, weak,
            sickly and ofttimes deformed. It, too, has paid the price of birth; it has given its
            little strength with every heartbeat, that it may be born, and now it is here, cheated
            and swindled of its birthright.</p>
        <p>Women, women, arouse yourselves! If you are not so unfortunately placed, it is but a
            trick of circumstances.</p>
        <p>If you are well clothed, well fed, today it is these women who have helped you to do so.
            And are you doing anything for these women? Ministers of the Gospel, what are you doing
            for these women and unborn babies? You reformers, conservatives, call yourselves what
            you wish, what are you doing for this condition of society which demands of its unborn
            such an awful price of birth? Do you think your duty is done if you have clothed or fed
            one or fifty of these victims for a day, a week, a year, perhaps? Oh, mothers, sisters,
            women of this land, awake! How can you slumber when these conditions exist?</p>
        <p>The day is passed when we can selfishly protect our own. In order to protect our own, in
            matters of disease, in conditions where milk, water, food or drugs are unsafe for our
            own loved ones, we cannot hesitate to fight for all, for we realize we can only save our
            own by so doing.</p>
        <p>Again I say: Women, awake, awake to this system and help these downtrodden women back to
            their homes, back to their little ones, back to that which belongs to every mother --
            the care and love of her offspring.</p>
        <p>By the way, do we ever hear the male element, who so strongly advocate "home duty" for
            the\ "bridge" mother, advocate home duty for these women? It is only the "bridge"
            women's children who need the care and attention of the mother, evidently.</p>
        <p>Let us turn to the mother we have just beheld with her new-born infant. What is to be
            done with this subnormal piece of humanity? Does it not need even more care and
            attention than a normal child? But what does it get? Dire poverty drives this mother
            back again to the factory (no intelligent person will say she goes willingly). It is the
            fear of the loss of a job, debts and another mouth to feed that compels her to leave
            this newborn infant in the care of any one who has the room to keep it. Any friend or
            neighbor who works at home can take care of this little waif.</p>
        <p>We all know the type -- hard working, ignorant, with scarcely time to attend to the
            actual needs of her own.</p>
        <p>The little one is placed here among the filth and debris of the workshop. It grows
            through babyhood and childhood motherless, fatherless and moralless.</p>
        <p>Of course, there are other alternatives, such as the charity kindergartens 
       &#8593;{so limited in number as to be negligible. --Ed.}&#8595;
    , but always the
            mother on the industrial field is cheated of love and care of her offspring.</p>
        <p>In this age of Christianity, in this advanced twentieth century, when science has
            discovered the methods of breeding the finest horses and dogs, when science has turned
            its searchlight upon every form of plant life: upon the different parasites which tend
            to destroy plant life, what has it done toward extricating the parasite poverty, which
            destroys humanity? Senator Owen, of
                Oklahoma, said recently:</p>
        <p>"We spend $500,000 to exterminate the insect that eats the cotton plant.
                ... We have millions for conservation of the forests. Our Senators and
                Representatives jump to their feet the minute one mentions raising the tariff on
                wool or on steel, but we can get no such interest when it comes to saving human
                lives."</p>
        <p>Look at the health report for the past three years and see the loss of children in New York City alone: 
                Under Under Under<br>one two five<br>Year. year. years. years.<br>
                1908 16,231 20,462 24,141<br>
                1909 15,976 20,716 24,519<br>
                1910 16,213 20,560 24,266
                <br>
             Or 48,420 little infants under one year of age and 72,926 children under five,
            all in three years. What a shameful slaughter! What a cowardly and selfish people to
            allow these modern Herods, Poverty and Ignorance, deliberately and
            silently to do away with this army of innocent and helpless babies!</p>
        <p> Why should these countless fathers and mothers, almost one million times greater in
            number, surrender to these few monster exploiters -- to this Capitalistic System which
            bases its existence on the fiendish exploitation, and ultimate murder of these
            children?</p>
        <p>We do not wonder such a small percentage of these children attain the age of puberty. Yet
            the manufacturer knows that his material must be well made, strong and firm; he knows
            the stronger and firmer it is woven, the better it will stand the wear and tear. Again,
            the tailor knows it takes time and care to make of this material a nicely shaped dress
            or coat, and if used before it's ready it will not be so serviceable.</p>
        <p>If man would do his duty to Human Beings, as well as he does to Things, we would have no
            need of leaving the little ones to the care of strangers all day. We would have no need
            of giving our babies' lives to the factory before they are born. We would have no need
            of seeing our little ones grow up in mental, moral, and physical starvation. We would
            have no need of suffering the awful pangs, of seeing them go out of the world, so soon,
            pangs which are so much keener than those which bring them here. All these and a
            thousand other sufferings and evils could be stamped out if man would do his duty.</p>
        <p>There are two steps toward progress in this universe -- organization and specialization.
            Mothers, let us not consider we are progressing. Let us not consider we have done our
            duty, until we have first organized. Then let us specialize in attacking and stamping
            out this social system.</p>
        <p>We must organize -- all women who have one vestige of love in our hearts, for children;
            all women who have interest in the progress of humanity; all should organize, but not
            alone.</p>
        <p>We should organize under a banner which advocates our cause. We should join the party
            (there is but one, the Socialist party) which solves the problems of each and
            every grievance of these working women and children.</p>
        <p>First, we should demand through this party absolute equality of the sexes.</p>
        <p>Second, to put back the mothers or the prospective mothers, into the homes, and give her
            a pension sufficient to keep herself and child. I can hear wails of protest concerning
            this last demand, on the ground that it will make vagrants of the fathers or will give
            them more time and money for saloons. All I can ask is that you look into this, find out
            what has been done, and the results you will find will remove that argument completely.
            It has been the experience of those interested in this, that when a man feels his
            burdens partly lifted, he is mentally and physically better fitted for life's work.</p>
        <p>Third, to support and educate the children, and by support we mean clearly to feed and
            clothe them, until they are at least 16 years of age.</p>
        <p>Fourth, to keep every child, regardless of race, color, or creed, in this United
                States out of all factories, mills, and all industrial fields which tend to
            dwarf the physical or mental development of the children.</p>
        <p>Last, to pull down completely this system, which mangles and stunts the minds, morals and
            bodies of our boys and men; to fight this awful viper, which undoes all our life's work,
            to crush and stamp it out forever. This, mothers, is a duty which must go hand in hand
            with our every day duties, or our life's work will be all for nothing.</p>
