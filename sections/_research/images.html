<p><img border="1" src="{% link images/research/ms_and_kids.jpg %}" align="right" width="233" height="200" style="margin-left: 15px;"> The Project
  receives many requests for images of Margaret Sanger.
  Though the Sanger Papers Project does own some images, we do not have the
  resources to provide photographic copies of them.</p>
<p>Instead, we recommend that you contact the following archives, some of which
  offer the ability to view images on-line.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.loc.gov/pictures/">The Library of
    Congress's Photographs and Prints Division</a> has a searchable catalog of
  images, many of which can be viewed on-line. The Library of Congress
  generally does not require a use fee to publish its images.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.corbis.com/">Corbis</a> has a searchable database of
  images. Use of these images will involve fees, but the site has a number
  of images of Margaret Sanger that cannot be found elsewhere. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.smith.edu/libraries/libs/ssc/findimages.html">The Sophia Smith
    Collection at Smith College</a> has a large archive of Sanger photos, which form
  a part of her papers. As yet, these images are not searchable on-line, but
  you can contact the archivists there for advice and to obtain photocopies before ordering
  prints. </p>
<p>We have identified the sources of all images mounted on our web
  site pages on <a href="{% link _research/image_credits.html %}">this page</a>. If you want to use any of the images on
  the web site, please contact the owner of the image (not the Project--unless
  the image is owned by the Sanger Papers) directly.</p>
