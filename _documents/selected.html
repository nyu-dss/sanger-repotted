  We have transcribed a few of Margaret Sanger's published articles and speeches, and will add more to this site as time permits.
  Any text added to the document by the Sanger Project editors (supplied dates, our reading of illegible or partially obscured
  words) is rendered in [<span class="italicText">square brackets and italics</span>]. Source notes at the bottom of each transcription give information
  regarding the location or original publication information. The location on our
  microfilm edition is cited as follows: LCM (Library of Congress microfilm), MSM (Margaret Sanger Microfilm): "S" for Smith College
