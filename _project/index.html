<p>The Margaret Sanger Papers Project is a historical editing project initially sponsored by the <a href="https://as.nyu.edu/history.html">Department of History</a> and
  then by the <a href="https://www.nyu.edu/academics/libraries.html">Division of Libraries</a> at <a href="https://www.nyu/edu">New York University</a>. The Project was formed
  by <a href="../esther_katz.html">Dr. Esther Katz</a> in 1985 to locate, arrange, edit, research, and publish the papers of the
  noted birth control pioneer.</p>

<p>The Margaret Sanger Papers Project has published a two-series microfilm edition, the <i><a href="../publications/microfilm.html">Margaret Sanger Papers Microfilm,</a></i>
  <a href="../publications/smith_series.html">Smith College Collections</a> and the
  <a href="../publications/collected_documents.html">Collected Documents Series</a>. Work on the Smith College Collections entailed the
  rearrangement and organization of over 50,000 Sanger documents in the Margaret Sanger collection and seventeen other collections at the Sophia Smith Collection and
  Smith College Archives. Work on the Collected Documents Series included a ten-year international search of over 1,500 archives and private collections, photocopying
  material and organizing over 9,000 documents for publication. Both series have been published with a printed reel guide that includes an item-level index by University Publications
  of America, now a division of <a href="https://www.proquest.com/">Proquest</a>. On online edition of the Project's micorfilm is available through Proquest's
  <a href="http://proquest.libguides.com/historyvault/sanger">History Vault</a></p>

<p>The Project has completed a four-volume book edition of Sanger's Papers, published by the <a href="http://www.press.uillinois.edu/" target="_new">University of
    Illinois Press</a>. The volumes are subtitled <i><a href="../publications/volume_i.html">The Woman Rebel, 1900-1928</a></i>, <i><a href="../publications/volume_ii.html">Birth Control Comes of Age, 1928-1939</a></i>,
  <a href="../publications/volume_iii.html">The Politics of Parenthood, 1939-1966</a></i>, and <i><a href="../publications/volume_iv.html">'Round the World for Birth Control,' 1920-1959</a>,</i> have been published.</p>

<p>The Project also published an electronic edition of a small sample of documents related to Sanger's <a href="../publications/mswomanrebel.html">The Woman Rebel</a>.</p>
