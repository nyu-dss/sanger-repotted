<h2>Selection</h2>

<p><img border="0" src="hitler_diary.jpg" align="right" width="218" height="350" style="margin-left: 15px">Margaret Sanger left a voluminous archive of over 120,000
letters, speeches, diaries and organizational and legal records documenting her
long and eventful life. Our goal in creating this volume has been to highlight
Sanger's distinctive voice and illuminate the multiple narratives of her life
and work. Our choices were governed by our desire to document critical events,
major themes and central issues of Sanger's life in the years 1900 to 1928,
and to reveal her thought processes and modes of expression. Some 80% of the
documents selected for this volume consist of letters, augmented by articles,
speeches and selections from Sanger's pamphlets, journals and diaries. We have
focused on including letters written by Sanger unless an incoming letter
provides indispensable context that cannot be adequately summarized, offers
critical information about Sanger and her agenda, or when Sanger's outgoing
letters have not been preserved. We have also included a representative
selection of letters written to Sanger by those seeking birth control advice.
All but a few of the vast number of organizational and legal documents have been
excluded. Documents are printed in their entirety with the exception of
pamphlets, diaries and journals (entries were selected from the larger document)
and testimony and newspaper interviews (we have included only Sanger's
contribution).</p>

<p>Margaret Sanger not only led the American movement, but
also sought to globalize birth control by organizing international conferences
and cultivating contacts among scientists, economists, social reformers and
population control leaders around the world. Much of her international work was,
by design, conducted independently of her leadership of the U.S. movement. We
have, therefore, omitted documents relating to her international work from this
and the two subsequent volumes of this edition, and will gather them in a
separate (fourth) volume.</p>

<h2>Establishing Text</h2>

<p>The majority of source texts used for this edition are
unique, but when there are multiple versions of letters, the recipient's copy
is used. In the case of multiple drafts of Sanger's speeches or articles, we
generally chose the one that most closely resembles the final version.
Occasionally a composite text was created from various incomplete versions (ex.
incomplete drafts of speeches with additional portions from published sources).
Exceptions to these guidelines are noted in the head notes or endnotes. Variant
versions of documents are cited in the source notes.</p>

<h2>Organization and Format of the Volumes</h2>

<p>Documents in the volumes are grouped into chronological
chapters. Because this is such a highly selective edition, we have sought to
provide narrative and chronological links in brief essays introducing each
chapter. Each document is preceded by a header identifying the author, recipient
or title. Explanatory head notes sometimes appear above documents to provide
context, or explain issues or events relating to their creation. Documents are
arranged in chronological order, and within that in alphabetical order by
author. Documents written on the same day are placed in the order in which they
were written. Documents dated only by month and year are placed at the end of
that month. A unnumbered source note follows each document providing an
abbreviation to describe the physical characteristics of the source text and its
provenance, followed by its microfilm location, information on variant versions,
notes on enclosures, anything notable about its physical condition (e.g. water
stains; ink blots), and other identifying information (letterhead, Sanger's
return address, etc.).</p>

<h2>Transcription</h2>

<p>Our transcription goal was to retain the authorial voice,
color and tone of the original by reproducing the source text as accurately as
possible. Original spelling, punctuation, paragraph division, abbreviations,
ampersands, superscript, and other idiosyncrasies have been preserved, as have
underlining and double underlining for emphasis (though text underlined more
than twice is rendered as double underline). Authors' use of initial capitals,
and capitalization as a means of emphasis has also been preserved. When
capitalization could not be determined, we have adopted standard usage. Terminal
punctuation rendered as long dashes or periods has also been retained. However,
when sentences are terminated by the use of extra spaces, or when terminal
punctuation is missing, the editors have silently supplied terminal periods.</p>

<p>Words or parts of words that are illegible or missing in
the source text are, wherever possible, supplied by the editors, (rendered as
entire words) in italics within square brackets. When the supplied information
is conjecture, the editors have followed that portion with a question mark. If
the information cannot be supplied, the missing portion is rendered as [<i>illegible</i>]
or [<i>pages missing or torn</i>].</p>

<p>To insure a more readable text we have standardized the
following elements: the first letter of each sentence is always capitalized; new
paragraphs always begin with the first five characters indented; the
complimentary closing is run into the last paragraph of letters; and signatures
are always placed at the right margin beneath the text. In typed, signed
letters, the handwritten signature is indicated by [<i>signed</i>] or [<i>initialed</i>],
following the name.</p>

<p>The place/date lines are always located flush to the right
margin; the salutation flush to the left margin. Document dates and places
written or typed by the author are rendered as they appear on the original,
though in place lines, street addresses and county names have been omitted. For
missing or incomplete dates, the editors have supplied the missing portion in
standardized form. Dates or places added to the documents by the recipient or a
third party have been omitted.</p>

<p>In letters written by Sanger, home and hotel addresses
have been retained, but appear in the source notes. As Sanger often used
whatever paper or stationary was at hand, we have determined that letterhead
alone is not sufficient to identify the place of origin. In these cases, Sanger's
location has been verified, and the missing place is supplied in standardized
form. For all letters written to Sanger, places of origin derived from
letterhead are accepted and rendered without italics and brackets. Places of
origin do not generally appear in speeches and published writings; if a place is
associated with such a document, it is provided in the source note.</p>

<p>Typographical errors and obvious slips of the pen have
been silently corrected, and closing quotation marks or parentheses silently
supplied. Cancelled text, interlineations, and/or other corrections and
additions to the text by the author have been retained and indicated through
symbols. Interlineations within the text are rendered within up and down arrows;
author insertions or intended interlineations that appear elsewhere on the
original (in the margins, or on the reverse, often with an arrow or other mark
directing its intended placement in the text), are placed at the appropriate
location in the text. Insertions that can be linked only to a paragraph, are
placed at the end of that paragraph, with an endnote indicating its location on
the original. When an author's insertion or margin note cannot be linked to a
specific point in the document, it is placed below the signature, preceded by an
editorial note describing its location on the original. Margin notes made by
someone other than the author are described in endnotes if linked to a specific
portion of the text, otherwise, in the source note. Because the originals are
available on microfilm, general routing notes (including stamps, collection
names, dates, etc.) as well as marks by archivists, researchers or others made
well after the document was created, have been omitted.</p>

<h2>Annotation</h2>
<p>Source notes are followed, when needed, by one or more
numbered endnotes which identify persons (and correct or identify partial names,
nicknames, initials, and misspelled names), places, organizations, technical,
medical or legal terms, publications (with bibliographic reference),
abbreviations, archaic and foreign words or phrases; explain textual
complexities in transcription; and contextualize events which are not explained
elsewhere in the document, chapter essay or headnote. Notes may also point the
reader to related material in the microfilm edition, and summarize documents
excluded from the volume in order to furnish context (when quotes are used in
head notes and endnotes, we have inserted ellipses to indicate omissions). The
editors have tried to identify every person mentioned in the text, generally at
the first full mention in a document. Location of the first biographical
identification is noted in the index. Editors have not indicated when people or
places are unidentified, though unidentified events and documents are noted.</p>
